The evolution of adiabatic and\nisocurvature density perturbations is described, and their effect on the large\nscale cmb anisotropy calculated as well as that of any gravitational waves. The\ngeneration of all three types of perturbation during inflation is described,\nand the normalisation and spectral indices are calculated in terms of the\ninflationary potential and its first and second derivatives. The comparison of\nthe theory with each type of observation is described, starting with the COBE\ndata and moving down in scale to the non-linear regime. Constraints on the\nspectrum of the adiabatic density perturbation are exhibited, the spectrum\nbeing parametrised by its normalisation and its degree of tilt. Finally\nextensions of the CDM model are considered, which replace some of the cold dark\nmatter by hot dark matter or a cosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 1993 10:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-30"}

No series commutations are involved in the\nprocedure; nevertheless the result is naturally split into the same three\ncontributions of very different nature, i.e. the series of Riemann zeta\nfunctions and the power and negative exponentially behaved functions,\nrespectively, well known from the original proof. The new theorem deals equally\nwell with elliptic differential operators whose spectrum is not explicitly\nknown. Rigorous results on the asymptoticity of the outcoming series are given,\ntogether with some specific examples. Exact analytical formulas, simplifying\napproximations and numerical estimates for the last of the three contributions\n(the most difficult to handle) are obtained. As an application of the method,\nthe summation of the series which appear in the analytic computation (for\ndifferent ranges of temperature) of the partition function of the string\n---basic in order to ascertain if QCD is some limit of a string theory--- is\nPERFORMED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 1993 15:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Each\nfamily consists of local deterministic oscillating lattice dynamics, with\nparallel discrete-time updating, parametrized by the range of interaction, the\n\"shape\" of its neighbor set, threshold value for contact updating, and number\nof possible states per site. GHM and CCA are mathematically tractable\nprototypes for the spatially distributed periodic wave activity of so-called\nexcitable media observed in diverse disciplines of experimental science.\nEarlier work by Fisch, Gravner, and Griffeath studied the ergodic behavior of\nthese excitable cellular automata on Z^2, and identified two distinct (but\nclosely-related) elaborate phase portraits as the parameters vary. In\nparticular, they noted the emergence of asymptotic phase diagrams (and\nEuclidean dynamics) in a well-defined threshold-range scaling limit. In this\nstudy we present several rigorous results and some experimental findings\nconcerning various phase transitions in the asymptotic diagrams, focusing on\nevaluating the limiting threshold cutoff for existence of the spirals that\ncharacterize many excitable media. For mathematical expediency our main results\nare formulated in terms of spo(p), the cutoff for existence of stable periodic\nobjects that arise as spiral cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 1993 20:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The new approximation\ndescribes the crossover from the mean-field rate-equation behavior at short\ntimes to the universal, fluctuation-dominated behavior at large times. The\napproximation becomes quantitatively accurate when the system is initially\nclose to the continuum behavior, i.e., for small initial density and fast\nreaction. For large initial density and slow reaction, lattice effects are\nnonnegligible for an extended initial time interval. In such cases our\napproximation provides the correct description of the initial mean-field as\nwell as the asymptotic large-time, fluctuation-dominated behavior. However, the\nintermediate-time crossover between the two regimes is described only\nsemiquantitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 1993 18:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-12"}

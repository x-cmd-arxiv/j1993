We show that every generic $R$-matrix leads to such\na braided Lie algebra with $[\\ ,\\ ]$ given by structure constants $c^{IJ}{}_K$\ndetermined from $R$. In this case $U(\\CL)=B(R)$ the braided matrices introduced\npreviously. We also introduce the basic theory of these braided Lie algebras,\nincluding the natural right-regular action of a braided-Lie algebra $\\CL$ by\nbraided vector fields, the braided-Killing form and the quadratic Casimir\nassociated to $\\CL$. These constructions recover the relevant notions for\nusual, colour and super-Lie algebras as special cases. In addition, the\nstandard quantum deformations $U_q(g)$ are understood as the enveloping\nalgebras of such underlying braided Lie algebras with $[\\ ,\\ ]$ on $\\CL\\subset\nU_q(g)$ given by the quantum adjoint action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 1993 15:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

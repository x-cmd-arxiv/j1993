The behaviour of the binding energy\nwith system size suggests the existence of a finite critical value of J above\nwhich binding occurs in the bulk. Only the d-wave pair field operator acting on\nthe Heisenberg GS has a finite overlap with the 2 hole ground state for all the\nclusters considered. The related spectral function associated with the\npropagation of a d-wave (spin singlet) pair of holes in the antiferromagnetic\nbackground is calculated. The quasiparticle peak at the bottom of the spectrum\nas well as some structure appearing above the peak survive with increasing\ncluster size. Although no simple scaling law was found for the quasiparticle\nweight the data strongly suggest that this weight is finite in the bulk limit\nand is roughly proportional to the antiferromagnetic coupling J (for J<1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 1993 11:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The action in four dimensions determines the\nquantum tunneling rate at zero temperature from a false vacuum state to the\ntrue vacuum state; similarly, the action in three dimensions determines the\nthermal tunneling rate for a finite temperature theory. We show that for all\nquartic potentials, the action can be obtained from a one parameter family of\ninstanton solutions corresponding to a one parameter family of differential\nequations. We find the solutions numerically and use polynomial fitting\nformulae to obtain expressions for the Euclidean action. These results allow\none to calculate tunneling rates for the entire possible range of quartic\npotentials, from the thin-wall (nearly degenerate) limit to the opposite limit\nof vanishing barrier height. We also present a similar calculation for\npotentials containing $\\varphi^4 \\ln \\varphi^2$ terms, which arise in the\none-loop approximation to the effective potential in electroweak theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 1993 18:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The calculations are performed within the\nBESS model which contains new vector resonances. If the mass $M_V$ of the new\nboson multiplet lies not far from the maximum machine energy, or if it is\nlower, such a resonant contribution would be quite manifest. A result of our\nanalysis is that also virtual effects are important. It appears that\nannihilation into a fermion pair in such machines, at the considered\nluminosities, would improve only marginally on existing limits if polarized\nbeams are available and left-right asymmetries are measured. On the other hand,\nthe process of $W$-pair production by $e^+e^-$ annihilation would allow for\nsensitive tests of the hypothesized strong sector, especially if the $W$\npolarizations are reconstructed from their decay distributions, and the more so\nthe higher the energy of the machine. An $e^+e^-$ collider with c.m. energy\n$\\sqrt{s}=500~GeV$ could improve the limits on the model for the range\n$500<M_V(GeV)<1000$ when $W$ polarization is not reconstructed. If $W$\npolarizations are reconstructed, then the bounds improve for the entire\nexpected range of $M_V$. These bounds become more stringent for larger energy\nof the collider. We have also studied the detectability of the new resonances\nthrough the fusion subprocesses, but this channel does not seem to be\ninteresting even for a collider with a c.m. energy $\\sqrt{s}=2~TeV$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 1993 12:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

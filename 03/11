Using existing\ndata on the chemical composition of cosmic rays near TeV energies as a\nconstraint, we adjust the parameters of the model to fit the shower size data\nfrom the Akeno experiment; this is necessary since the derivation of an all\nparticle spectrum involves an assumption about the chemical composition of the\ncosmic rays and so we have to fit the shower size data first and then derive\nthe all particle spectrum. We present a successful fit to the shower size data\nwhich allows us to draw three main conclusions: a) For most of the energy range\nabove $10^5$ GeV the wind explosions can account for both chemical composition\nand spectrum including the knee feature, b) the highest particle energies\nrequired from the stellar wind explosions imply a magnetic field in the\npreexisting stellar wind of at least $3$ Gauss at a fiducial distance of\n$10^{14}$ cm, c) the chemical abundances above $10^5$ GeV are dominated by\nheavy nuclei such as Neon and higher. The bump observed in the all particle\nspectrum below the knee gets weakened with the proper treatment of the energy\ndependent chemical composition. For high energies we obtain an estimate of the\nextragalactic proton flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 1993 13:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

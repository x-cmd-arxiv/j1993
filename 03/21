KAM theorem is equivalent to a ultraviolet stability\ntheorem. A renormalization group treatment of the field theory leads to a\nresummation of the formal pertubation series and to an expansion in terms of\nnew parameters (identified as a family of renormalization constants). The new\nparameters are analytic in the coupling (at small coupling): the breakdown of\nthe tori at large coupling is speculated to be related to the crossing of a\n\"critical\" surface at a value where the renormalization constants are still\nfinite. A mechanism for the possible universality of the singularities of\nparametric equations for the invariant tori, in their parameter dependence as\nwell as in the coupling dependence, is proposed.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 1993 18:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-08"}

Ashtekar has suggested using the\ncondition that a given representation of the algebra of quantum observables is\na *-representation to fix the inner product on the space of physical states.\nThis idea is of particular interest for the quantisation of gravity where an\nobvious prescription for defining an inner product is lacking. The results of\nthis paper show rigorously that Ashtekar's criterion does suffice to determine\nthe inner product in very general circumstances. Two versions of the result are\nproved: a simpler one which only applies to representations by bounded\noperators and a more general one which allows for unbounded operators.

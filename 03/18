A very faint ring-arc of\n\\ion{H}{2} regions is also seen associated with a third outer ring or shell. An\ninvestigation of the H$\\alpha$ fluxes in the rings reveals an increase in the\nemission where the ring surface density in the R-band light exceeds\n21.3$\\pm$0.2 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. If the R-band light is dominated by old stars\nin the underlying density wave, then the results suggest evidence for a Star\nFormation law which exhibits a threshold dependence on the strength of the\ndensity wave in the rings. Even if the R-band continuum in the ring is heavily\ncontaminated with red light from the underlying young stars then a smaller, but\nstill significant non-linear enhancement in the star formation rates (SFR) in\none segment of the second ring is required to explain the results. In either\ncase, strong trends in the SFR with azimuth around Ring~2 are in good agreement\nwith off-center collisional ring galaxy models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 1993 21:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

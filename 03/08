A local phase slip affects globally the system, which is in strong\ncontrast with kink propagation. Attractors with different velocities coexist,\nand form quantized bands determined by the number of phase slips. The mechanism\nand statistical and dynamical characters are studied with the use of spatial\nasymmetry, basin volume ratio, Lyapunov spectra, and mutual information. If the\nsystem size is not far from an integer multiple of the selected wavelength,\nattractors are tori, while weak chaos remains otherwise, which induces chaotic\nmodulation of waves or a chaotic itinerancy of traveling states. In the\nitinerancy, the residence time distribution obeys the power law distribution,\nimplying the existence of a long-ranged correlation. Supertransients before the\nformation of traveling waves are noted in the high nonlinearity regime. In the\nweaker nonlinearity regime corresponding to the frozen random pattern, we have\nfound fluctuation of domain sizes and Brownian-like motion of domains.\nPropagation of chaotic domains by phase slips is also found. Relevance of our\ndiscoveries to B\\'{e}nard convection experiments and possible applications to\ninformation processing are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 1993 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The chiral perturbation series is obtained to\norder $E^4$ from a chiral $SU(2)\\times SU(2)$ invariant effective Lagrangian.\nAt order $E^4$, we isolate the low-energy manifestation of heavy particle\nexchange in the s-channel. We find that the contributions of this type to the\nI=1 and I=2 amplitudes have a one parameter dependence. This observation\nprovides a symmetry rationale for Chanowitz's recent observation that in a\nchiral model with an explicitly coupled $\\rho$, the I=1 and I=2 channels are\nstrongly correlated. In order to realize, in a quantitative way, the fact that\nin the resonance region the direct-channel dominates, we make use of a simple\nand intuitive unitarization scheme. This allows us to derive a renormalization\nconstant-independent relation for the I=1 and I=2 phase shifts. With the\nassumption of a $\\rho$-resonance, this relation determines the position of a\npole at euclidean momentum in the I=2 channel. Through an analysis based on the\ntheory of redundant poles and the Adler sum rule we show that this ``tachyon''\npole actually represents a physical contribution to the unitary amplitude which\naccounts for $\\rho$ and $\\epsilon$ exchange in the u-channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 1993 01:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

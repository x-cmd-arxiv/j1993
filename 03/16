The presence of a confining potential in addition to the magnetic field\nremoves the degeneracy of the Landau levels and allows one to associate a group\nvelocity with each single-particle state. The distribution function describing\nthe occupation of these single-particle states satisfies a Boltzmann equation,\nwhich may be solved exactly in the case of impurity scattering. In the case\nwhere the electrons scatter against both phonons and impurities we solve\nnumerically - and in certain limits analytically - the integral equation for\nthe distribution function, and determine the conductivity as a function of\ntemperature and magnetic field. The magnetoconductivity exhibits a maximum at a\ntemperature, which depends on the relative strength of the impurity and\nelectron-phonon scattering, and shows oscillations when the Fermi energy or the\nmagnetic field is varied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 1993 02:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The procedure does\nnot require assumptions about the hard scattering rate inside the nuclear\nmedium. Instead, the hard scattering rate is deduced directly from the data.\nThe only theoretical input necessary is in modelling the attenuation due to the\nnuclear medium, for which we use a simple exponential law. We apply this\nprocedure to the Brookhaven experiment of Carroll et al and find that it\nclearly shows color transparency: the effective attenuation cross section in\nevents with momentum transfer $Q^2$ is approximately $40\\ mb\\ (2.2\\\nGeV^2/Q^2)$. The fit to the data also supports the idea that the hard\nscattering inside the nuclear medium is closer to perturbative QCD predictions\nthan is the scattering of isolated protons in free space.

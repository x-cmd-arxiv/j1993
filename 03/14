Although\nthe models are non-renormalizable, the proof is done in an analogous manner to\nthe renormalization proof of gauge theories and two-dimensional nonlinear sigma\nmodels by restricting ourselves to the operators with two derivatives (counting\na hidden gauge boson field as one derivative), i.e., with dimension 2, which\nare the only operators relevant to the low energy limit. Through loop-wise\nmathematical induction based on the Ward-Takahashi identity for the BRS\nsymmetry, we solve renormalization equation for the effective action up to\ndimension-2 terms plus terms with the relevant BRS sources. We then show that\nall the quantum corrections to the dimension-2 operators, including the finite\nparts as well as the divergent ones, can be entirely absorbed into a\nre-definition (renormalization) of the parameters and the fields in the\ndimension-2 part of the tree-level Lagrangian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Mar 1993 14:03:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 1993 13:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

This connection\nallows us to clarify a few of the assertions and conjectures stated in the work\nof Nahm-Recknagel-Terhoven concerning the role of algebraic $K$-theory and\nThurston's program on hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Specifically, it is not related\nto hyperbolic 3-manifolds as suggested but is more appropriately related to the\ngroup manifold of the universal covering group of the projective special linear\ngroup of all $2 \\times 2$ real matrices viewed as a topological group. This\nalso resolves the weaker version of the conjecture as formulated by Kirillov.\nWe end with the summary of a number of open conjectures on the mathematical\nside.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 1993 15:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We first consider the question of what sets of\ncommuting charges can be constructed from the current of a \\mbox{\\sf U}(1)\nKac-Moody algebra. It emerges that there exists a set $S_n$ of such charges for\neach positive integer $n>1$; the corresponding value of the central charge in\nthe Feigin-Fuchs realization of the stress tensor is $c=13-6n-6/n$. The charges\nin each series can be written in terms of the generators of an exceptional\n\\W-algebra. We show that the \\W-algebras that arise in this way are symmetries\nof Liouville theory for special values of the coupling. We then exhibit a\nrelationship between the \\nls equation and the KP hierarchy. From this it\nfollows that there is a relationship between the \\nls equation and the algebra\n\\Wi. These examples provide evidence for our conjecture that the phenomenon of\nintegrability is intimately linked with properties of infinite dimensional\nalgebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 1993 15:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

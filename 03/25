We use the basic concept\nthat the cosmic ray particles are accelerated in a supernova shock that travels\nthrough the interstellar medium. Physically important ingredients besides the\npresence of a strong shock are diffusion, drifts, convection, adiabatic\ncooling, the injection history, and the topology of the magnetic field, here\nassumed for simplicity to be homogeneous in the interstellar medium. The result\nis a spectrum, which for strong shocks in a gas with adiabatic index 5/3 yields\na spectrum of E^-2.42. Interstellar turbulence with a Kolmogorov spectrum then\nleads by leakage from the galactic disk to a spectrum which is E^-2.75, as\nobserved. We argue that the ratio of cosmic ray electrons to protons is\ndetermined by the amount of expansion which takes place from the cessation of\nelectron injection to the break-up of the shell by cooling instabilities. Since\nthe highest particle energy reached derives from geometrical arguments, it\ndepends on the charge of the nucleus and so higher Z elements are predicted to\nreach higher energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 1993 12:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We examine the important question whether these\ncoexistence anomalies are of relevance also in more realistic systems\ndisplaying anisotropies. By applying a generalized renormalization scheme to\nthe time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau models, we treat two quite different but\ncharacteristic cases, namely the influence of (i) weak cubic anisotropies, and\n(ii) long-range dipolar interactions. In the presence of cubic terms, the\ntransverse excitations acquire a mass and thus one expects the theory to\napproach an uncritical \"Gaussian\" regime in the limit ${\\vec q} \\rightarrow 0$\nand $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$. Therefore, we first consider the one-component case\nin order to show that our formalism also provides a consistent description of\nthe crossover into an asymptotically Gaussian theory. In the case of (weak)\ncubic anisotropies, the fact that for $n < 4$ the fluctuations tend to restore\nthe $O(n)$-symmetry at the critical point proves to be most important, since\nunder these circumstances coexistence-type singularities may be found in an\nintermediate wavenumber and frequency range. The dipolar interaction induces an\nanisotropy in momentum space, which does not completely destroy the massless\ncharacter of the transverse fluctuations, but only effectively reduces the\nnumber of Goldstone modes by one. Remarkably, similar to the isotropic case the\nasymptotic theory can be treated exactly. For $n \\geq 3$ we find coexistence\nanomalies governed by the isotropic power laws. However, the amplitudes of the\nrespective scaling functions depend on the angle between order parameter and\nexternal wavevector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 1993 09:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Perturbative results for spontaneously-broken\ntheories are first organised into reggeon diagrams. Unbroken gauge theories are\nstudied via a reggeon diagram infra-red analysis of symmetry restoration.\nMassless fermions play a crucial role and the case of QCD involves the\nSuper-Critical Pomeron as an essential intermediate stage. An introductory\nreview of the build up of transverse momentum diagrams and reggeon diagrams\nfrom leading log calculations in gauge theories is presented first. It is then\nshown that the results closely reproduce the general structure for multi-regge\namplitudes derived in Part I of the article, allowing the construction of\ngeneral reggeon diagrams for spontaneously-broken theories. Next it is argued\nthat, with a transverse-momentum cut-off, unbroken gauge theories can be\nreached through an infra-red limiting process which successively decouples\nfundamental representation Higgs fields . The first infra-red limit studied is\nthe restoration of SU(2) gauge symmetry. The analysis is dominated by the\nexponentiation of divergences imposed by Reggeon Unitarity and the contribution\nof massless quarks ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 1993 14:33:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 1993 10:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The $\\pi\\!-\\!\\eta$\nmixing amplitude is calculated in a hadronic model where the mixing is driven\nby the neutron-proton mass difference. Closed-form analytic expressions are\npresented in terms of a few nucleon-meson parameters. The observed momentum\ndependence of the mixing amplitude is strong enough as to question earlier\ncalculations of charge-symmetry-breaking observables based on the on-shell\nassumption. The momentum dependence of the $\\pi\\!-\\!\\eta$ amplitude is,\nhowever, practically identical to the one recently predicted for $\\rho-\\omega$\nmixing. Hence, in this model, the ratio of pseudoscalar to vector mixing\namplitudes is, to a good approximation, a constant solely determined from\nnucleon-meson coupling constants. Furthermore, by selecting these parameters in\naccordance with charge-symmetry-conserving data and SU(3)-flavor symmetry, we\nreproduce the momentum dependence of the $\\pi\\!-\\!\\eta$ mixing amplitude\npredicted from chiral perturbation theory. Alternatively, one can use\nchiral-perturbation-theory results to set stringent limits on the value of the\n$NN\\eta$ coupling constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 1993 16:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

While having the same topology as the standard Kruskal model, none\nof these manifolds is diffeomorphic to standard Kruskal, although under certain\nconditions some global smooth Lorentz-signature metric can be continued from\nthe local Kruskal form. Consequently, it can be conjectured that such manifolds\nrepresent an infinity of physically inequivalent (non-diffeomorphic) space-time\nmodels for black holes. However, at present nothing definitive can be said\nabout the continued satisfaction of the Einstein equations.

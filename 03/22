It has been proposed that a dynamically generated gauge\nfield must appear in the effective field theory. Even a simple spinon-gauge\nsystem is complicated, becoming strongly coupled at low energy. We show that in\na large-$n$ approximation the theory can be solved and has a nontrivial fixed\npoint. Also, we find that there is no antiferromagnetic instability at weak\ncoupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Mar 1993 19:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We reexamine this model and find that the sterile\nneutrinos can be either hot, warm, or cold dark matter. Since their only direct\ncoupling is to left-handed or active neutrinos, the most efficient production\nmechanism is via neutrino oscillations. If the production rate is always less\nthan the expansion rate, then these neutrinos will never be in thermal\nequilibrium. However, enough of them may be produced so that they provide the\nmissing mass necessary for closure. We consider a single generation of neutrino\nfields $\\left (\\nu_L,\\,\\nu_R\\right )$ with a Dirac mass, $\\mu$, and a Majorana\nmass for the right-handed components only, $M$. For $M\\gg \\mu$ we show that the\nnumber density of sterile neutrinos is proportional to $\\mu^2/M$ so that the\nenergy density today is {\\it independent of} $M$. However $M$ is crucial in\ndetermining the large scale structure of the Universe. In particular, $M\\simeq\n0.1-1.0 {\\rm ~keV}$ leads to warm dark matter and a structure formation\nscenario that may have some advantages over both the standard hot and cold dark\nmatter scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 1993 13:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

It turns out that these equations can be linked to certain\nholomorphic vector bundles on the N-th Cartesian power of an elliptic curve.\nThese bundles are naturally constructed by a gluing procedure from a system of\ntrigonometric quantum affine $R$-matrices. Meromorphic solutions of the quantum\nKZ equations are interpreted as sections of such a bundle. This interpretation\nis an analogue of the interpretation of solutions of the classical KZ equations\nas sections of a flat vector bundle. Matrix elements of intertwiners between\nrepresentations of the quantum affine algebra correspond to regular\n(holomorphic) sections. The vector bundle obtained from the quantum KZ system\nis topologically nontrivial. Its topology can be completely described in terms\nof crystal bases, using the crystal limit ``q goes to 0''. In the case N=2,\nthis bundle is is essentially a bundle on an elliptic curve which is shown to\nbe semistable (for the case of quantum sl(2)) if the parameters take generic\nvalues. The proof makes use of the crystal limit ``q goes to 0''. Finally, we\ngive a vector bundle interpretation of the generalized quantum KZ equations for\narbitrary affine root systems defined recently by Cherednik.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 1993 14:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

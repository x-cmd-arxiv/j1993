For an extensive sample of\nnearby galaxies, listed in the ``Nearby Galaxies Catalogue'' (Tully, 1988a), we\nhave found that the spirals characterized by a high local density tend to be\nbarred if they are early-type and early-type if they are barred (at the\nsignificance level of $\\sim$3 sigma), confirming some earlier suggestion of low\nstatistical significance. This fact, which is observed substantially in\nlow-luminosity spirals, indicates that galaxy interactions can stimulate the\nformation of bars, primarily in early-type, low-luminosity spirals. This is in\npartial, qualitative agreement with the most recent relevant N-body\nsimulations. On the other hand, no significant density segregation is observed\nbetween pure S-shaped (S(s)) spirals and spirals with inner rings (S(r)), which\nare often associated with bars. {\\it Subject headings:} galaxies: general ---\ngalaxies: structure --- galaxies: interactions --- galaxies: clustering\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 1993 12:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The key to this picture is the realization that the constant\nbackground field (the mode with zero 4-momentum) renormalizes differently from\nthe fluctuation field (the finite-momentum modes). This picture reconciles\nrigorous results and lattice calculations with one-loop and\nGaussian-approximation analyses. Because of \"triviality\", these latter two\nmethods should be effectively exact. Indeed, they yield the same renormalized\neffective potential and the same relation m_h^2 = 8 pi^2 v^2 between the\nparticle mass and the physical vacuum expectation value. This relation predicts\na Higgs mass m_h about 2 TeV in the standard model.

We shall interpret ``nice'' as Souslin as\nsuggested by Judah Shelah [JdSh 292].

Concerning the second class we\nhave weak results, concerning the first class, our results look satisfactory.\nWe have two main results: one (1.14) says that Cohen forcing is ``minimal'' in\nthe first class, the other (1.10) says that all c.c.c.

By numerically\nsimulating the perturbed evolution, we estimate the information needed to\nfollow a perturbed Hilbert-space vector in time. We find that the Landauer\nerasure cost associated with this information grows very rapidly and becomes\nmuch larger than the maximum statistical entropy given by the logarithm of the\ndimension of Hilbert space. The quantum baker's map thus displays a\nhypersensitivity to perturbations that is analogous to behavior found earlier\nin the classical case. This hypersensitivity characterizes ``quantum chaos'' in\na way that is directly relevant to statistical physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 1993 00:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

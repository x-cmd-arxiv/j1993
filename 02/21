The depositing particles are\nrepresented by hard-core extended objects; they are not allowed to overlap.\nNumerical Monte Carlo studies and analytical considerations are reported for 1D\nand 2D models of multilayer adsorption processes. Deposition without screening\nis investigated, in certain models the density may actually increase away from\nthe substrate. Analytical studies of the late stage coverage behavior show the\ncrossover from exponential time dependence for the lattice case to the power\nlaw behavior in the continuum deposition. 2D lattice and continuum simulations\nrule out some \"exact\" conjectures for the jamming coverage. For the deposition\nof dimers on a 1D lattice with diffusional relaxation we find that the limiting\ncoverage (100%) is approached according to the ~1/t**0.5 power-law preceded,\nfor fast diffusion, by the mean-field crossover regime with the intermediate\n~1/t behavior. In case of k-mer deposition (k>3) with diffusion the void\nfraction decreases according to the power-law t**[-1/(k-1)]. In the case of RSA\nof lattice hard squares in 2D with diffusional relaxation the approach to the\nfull coverage is ~t**(-0.5).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 1993 23:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

Using the new canonical coordinates, it is then easy to obtain\nexplicit expressions of Dirac observables, i.e.\\ phase space functions which\ncommute weakly with the constraint. This, in turn, enables us to carry out a\ngeneral quantization program to completion. We are also able to address the\nissue of time through ``deparametrization'' and discuss physical questions such\nas the fate of initial singularities in the quantum theory. We find that they\npersist in the quantum theory {\\it inspite of the fact that the evolution is\nimplemented by a 1-parameter family of unitary transformations}. Finally,\ncertain of these models admit conditional symmetries which are explicit already\nprior to the canonical transformation. These can be used to pass to quantum\ntheory following an independent avenue. The two quantum theories --based,\nrespectively, on Dirac observables in the new canonical variables and\nconditional symmetries in the original ADM variables-- are compared and shown\nto be equivalent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 1993 07:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-10"}

We also show that Wijsman convergence implies Mosco convergence\nprecisely when the weak star and Mackey topologies coincide on the dual sphere.\nA corollary of these results is that given a fixed norm on an Asplund space,\nWijsman and slice convergence coincide if and only if Wijsman convergence\nimplies Mosco convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 1993 17:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

We examine experimental results obtained for\nfew-body nuclei at Bates and Saclay using models of the charge operator that\ninclude both one- and two-body terms. Previous analyses using one-body terms\nonly have failed to reproduce experimental results. However, we find that the\nsame operators which have been used to successfully describe the charge form\nfactors also produce substantial agreement with measurements of the Coulomb\nsum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 1993 21:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 1993 02:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

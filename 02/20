The methods presented allow a simple interpretation\nof the results. For finite range interactions interesting nonunivesal spectral\nfeatures emerge for momenta which differ from the Fermi points by the order of\nthe inverse interaction range or more. For a simplified model with interactions\nonly within the branches of right and left moving electrons analytical\nexpressions for the spectral function are presented which allows to perform the\nthermodynamic limit. As in the general spinless model and the model including\nspin for which we present mainly numerical results the spectral functions do\nnot approach the noninteracting limit for large momenta. The implication of our\nresults for recent high resolution photoemission measurements on quasi\none-dimensional conductors are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 1993 16:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

It is shown how the specific couplings in the many-particle\nHamiltonian depend on the magnetic field and the area density of electrons. The\ndegeneracies of the quasi-particle states are related to the fractional filling\nfactors $\\nu$.

The functional form of the solutions is\nduality-invariant. Axion-dilaton black holes with zero entropy and zero area of\nthe horizon form a family of stable particle-like objects, which we call {\\it\nholons}. We study the quantization of the charges of these objects and its\ncompatibility with duality symmetry. In general the spectrum of black-hole\nsolutions with quantized charges is not invariant under $SL(2,R)$ but only\nunder $SL(2,Z)$ or one of its subgroups $\\Gamma_{l}$. Because of their\ntransformation properties, the asymptotic value of the axion-dilaton field of a\nblack hole may be associated with the modular parameter $\\tau$ of some complex\ntorus and the integer numbers $(n,m)$ that label its quantized electric and\nmagnetic charges may be associated with winding numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 1993 06:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

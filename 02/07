As well as looking at single-particle\ncorrelations, such as $n_{{\\bf k}\\sigma }=\\langle c^\\dagger _{{\\bf k}\\sigma\n}c_{{\\bf k}\\sigma } \\rangle $, we also study {\\it N-particle correlation\nfunctions} which compare the relative positions of {\\it all} the particles in\ndifferent models. In particular we study 16 and 18-site clusters and compare\nthe charge correlations in the Hubbard model with those of spinless fermions\nand hard-core bosons. We find that although low densities of holes favour a\n`locally-ferromagnetic' fermionic description, the correlations at larger\ndensities resemble those of pure hard-core bosons surprisingly well .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 1993 16:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

I review the properties of the lightest\nneutralino as a candidate for solving the dark matter problem. I discuss the\nneutralino's phenomenological and cosmological properties, and constraints from\npresent and future experiments. In the minimal supersymmetric model, the\nneutralino mass has been experimentally excluded below some $20$ GeV, and is\nnot expected to be significantly larger than about $150$ GeV. I identify a\ngaugino-like neutralino as the most natural dark matter candidate for a\nplausible range of parameters. The requirement that the lightest neutralino be\nthe dominant matter component in the flat Universe provides non-trivial\nrestrictions on other parameters of the model, in particular on the masses of\nthe sfermions. Next, I study the consequences of adopting further grand\nunification assumptions. In both scenarios I find sfermion masses most likely\nbeyond the reach of LEP 200 and the Tevatron but well within the discovery\npotential of the SSC and the LHC. I also comment on the effects of relaxing\ngrand unification assumptions. Finally, I briefly outline prospects for the\nneutralino dark matter searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 1993 17:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

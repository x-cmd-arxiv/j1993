The resulting dynamics is reversible and deterministic, but does not\npreserve Liouville measure. For a sufficiently small field, we prove the\nfollowing results: (1) existence of a unique stationary, ergodic measure\nobtained by forward evolution of initial absolutely continuous distributions,\nfor which the Pesin entropy formula and Young's expression for the fractal\ndimension are valid; (2) exact identity of the steady-state thermodyamic\nentropy production, the asymptotic decay of the Gibbs entropy for the\ntime-evolved distribution, and minus the sum of the Lyapunov exponents; (3) an\nexplicit expression for the full nonlinear current response (Kawasaki formula);\nand (4) validity of linear response theory and Ohm's transport law, including\nthe Einstein relation between conductivity and diffusion matrices. Results (2)\nand (4) yield also a direct relation between Lyapunov exponents and zero-field\ntransport (=diffusion) coefficients. Although we restrict ourselves here to\ndimension $d=2,$ the results carry over to higher dimensions and to some other\nphysical situations: e.g. with additional external magnetic fields. The proofs\nuse a well-developed theory of small perturbations of hyperbolic dynamical\nsystems and the method of Markov sieves, an approximation of Markov partitions.\nIn our context we discuss also the van Kampen objection to linear response\ntheory, which, we point out, overlooks the ``structural stability'' of strongly\nhyperbolic flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 1993 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

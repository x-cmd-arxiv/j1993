As the\nradio background, the wealth of data on source counts make possible reliable\nestimations of the contribution from extragalactic sources. At 178 MHz we\nobtain an antenna temperature of about 22 K, with the 60% of the flux\ncontributed by radiogalaxies and quasars and the remaining part from sub-mJy\nradio sources. At high frequencies the compact sources, generally QSOs,\ndominate. An intense far-IR/sub-mm background is predicted if a large fraction\nof the hard X-ray Background (XRB) comes from starburst galaxies but this might\nface problems with the upper limits on the far-IR isotropic flux. To clarify\nthe problem spectral measurements should be complemented with the analysis of\nsmall scale anisotropies. The flattening of the QSO counts at B=19.5 suggests\nthat their contribution to the optical/near-IR background is small in\ncomparison to that of galaxies. As for the XRB, a consisting picture obtains\nconsidering two AGN populations: a \"soft X-ray spectrum\" population and a \"hard\nX-ray spectrum\" one, mainly contributing to the soft and to the hard XRB\nrespectively. A third population of extremely absorbed or of reflection\ndominated AGN could either be the dominant contributor of the XRB above 3 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 1993 16:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

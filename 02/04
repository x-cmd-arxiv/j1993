There is no\nestablished consensus on how this transport takes place. We note that for\nphenomenological reasons the traditional $\\alpha$ model is probably not a good\ndescription of real disks. We discuss models in which angular momentum\ntransport is driven by shocks, and by magnetic field instabilities. The latter\nis more promising, but requires a dynamo. We note that the direction of angular\nmomentum transport due to convection in a conducting disk is not known as\ncompeting mechanisms are at work. We briefly discuss a number of possible\ndynamo mechanisms, and their problems. We then give a detailed exposition of\nthe internal wave driven dynamo model, in which internal waves excited at large\nradii drive an $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 1993 16:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

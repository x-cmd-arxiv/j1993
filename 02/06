This is based on the appearance of\nnon--renormalizable couplings in the superpotential. In particular, if $H_1H_2$\nis an allowed operator by all the symmetries of the theory, it is natural to\npromote the usual renormalizable superpotential $W_o$ to $W_o+\\lambda W_o\nH_1H_2$, yielding an effective $\\mu$ parameter whose size is directly related\nto the gravitino mass once supersymmetry is broken (this result is maintained\nif $H_1H_2$ couples with different strengths to the various terms present in\n$W_o$). On the other hand, the $\\mu$ term must be absent from $W_o$, otherwise\nthe natural scale for $\\mu$ would be $M_P$. Remarkably enough, this is entirely\njustified in the supergravity theories coming from superstrings, where mass\nterms for light fields are forbidden in the superpotential. We also analyse the\n$SU(2)\\times U(1)$ breaking, finding that it takes place satisfactorily.\nFinally, we give a realistic example in which supersymmetry is broken by\ngaugino condensation, where the mechanism proposed for solving the $\\mu$\nproblem can be gracefully implemented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 1993 19:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We begin with an\nanalysis of the nature and origin of irreversibility in well-known physical\nprocesses such as dispersion, diffusion, dissipation and mixing, and make the\ndistinction between processes whose irreversibility arises from the stipulation\nof special initial conditions, and those arising from the system's interaction\nwith a coarse-grained environment. We then study the irreversibility associated\nwith quantum fluctuations in cosmological processes like particle creation and\nthe `birth of the Universe'. We suggest that the backreaction effect of such\nquantum processes can be understood as the manifestation of a\nfluctuation-dissipation relation relating fluctuations of quantum fields to\ndissipations in the dynamics of spacetime. For the same reason it is shown that\ndissipation is bound to appear in the dynamics of minisuperspace cosmologies.\nThis provides a natural course for the emergence of a cosmological and\nthermodynamic arrow of time and suggests a meaningful definition of\ngravitational entropy.

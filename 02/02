Quantum mechanics of anyon\nfluids is precisely described by Chern-Simons gauge theory. The random phase\napproximation (RPA), the linearized self-consistent field method (SCF), and the\nhydrodynamic approach employed in the early analysis of anyon fluids are all\nequivalent. Relations and differences between neutral and charged anyon fluids\nare discussed. It is necessary to go beyond RPA and the linearized SCF, and\npossively beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation, to correctly describe various\nphenomena such as the flux quantization, vortex formation, and phase\ntransition.\n  Topics includes: Anyons, Aharonov-Bohm effect, Chern-Simons gauge theory,\nHartree-Fock ground state, RPA and SCF, Path integral representation, RPA =\nlinearized SCF, Response functions, Phonons and plasmons, Hydrodynamic\ndescription, Effective theory, Meissner effect at zero and finite temperature,\nde Haas - van Alphen effect in SCF, Thermodynamic potential in inhomogeneous\nfields, T_c, Other important issues.

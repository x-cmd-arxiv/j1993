The effective chiral Lagrangian formulated in terms of the\npseudoscalar Goldstone bosons ($\\pi, \\, K, \\, \\eta$) is briefly discussed. It\nis shown how one can gain insight into the ratios of the light quark masses and\nto what extent these statements are model--independent. A few selected topics\nconcerning the dynamics and interactions of the Goldstone bosons are\nconsidered. These are $\\pi \\pi$ and $\\pi K$ scattering, some non--leptonic kaon\ndecays and the problem of strong pionic final state interactions. CHPT also\nallows to make precise statements about the temperature dependence of QCD Green\nfunctions and the finite size effects related to the propagation of the\n(almost) massless pseudoscalar mesons. A central topic is the inclusion of\nmatter fields, baryon CHPT. The relativistic and the heavy fermion formulation\nof coupling the baryons to the Goldstone fields are discussed. As applications,\nphoto--nucleon processes, the $\\pi N$ $\\Sigma$--term and non--leptonic hyperon\ndecays are presented. Implications of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry\non the nuclear forces and meson exchange currents are also described. Finally,\nthe use of effective field theory methods in the strongly coupled Higgs sector\nand in the calculation of oblique electroweak corrections is touched upon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 1993 10:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-17"}

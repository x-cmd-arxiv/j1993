Thus, the observed statistical properties of the galaxy\ndistribution do not necessarily extend to the underlying matter distribution.\nGravitational evolution of initially Gaussian seed fluctuations predicts that\nthe connected moments of the matter fluctuations exhibit a hierarchical\nstructure, at least in the limit of small dispersion. This same hierarchical\nstructure has been found in the galaxy distribution, but it is not clear to\nwhat extent it reflects properties of the matter distribution or properties of\na galaxy formation bias. In this paper we consider the consequences of an\narbitrary, effectively local biasing transformation of a hierarchical\nunderlying matter distribution.

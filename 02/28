There exist unmeasured spin-dependent\nstructure functions ($b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$, and $b_4$) for spin-one hadrons such\nas the deuteron. The tensor structure function $b_1(x)$ could be measured by\nthe proposed 15 GeV European Electron Facility. The measurement provides\nimportant clues to physics of non-nucleonic components in spin-one nuclei and\nto tensor structures on the quark-parton level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 1993 12:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The main result of this paper is the following:\n  THEOREM: Gregorieff forcing does not satisfy Axiom A. To prove this we use\nthe following game, denoted G(U), for two players playing alternatively:\n  Player I plays a partition of omega, {J_n| n<omega}, such that for all\nn<omega, J_n is an element of I;\n  At the nth turn Player II plays a finite subset F_n of J_n. Player II wins\niff the union of the F_n is an element of U.\n  The following two Lemmas prove the Theorem:\n  LEMMA 1: If P(U) satisfies axiom A, then player II has a winning strategy in\nthe game G(U).\n  LEMMA 2:The game G(U) is undetermined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 1993 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

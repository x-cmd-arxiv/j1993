Such a cancellation is absent if the\nresonance has a spin two.

If open and/or\nunoriented strings are allowed, there are no non-trivial modular\ntransformations in the additional genus-one amplitudes (Klein bottle, annulus\nand M\\\"obius strip). As originally recognized by Green and Schwarz, in the\nten-dimensional type-I superstring the anomaly cancellation results from a\ndelicate interplay between the contributions of these additional surfaces. In\nlower-dimensional models, the possible presence of a number of antisymmetric\ntensors yields a generalization of the Green-Schwarz mechanism. I illustrate\nthese results by referring to some six-dimensional chiral models, and I\nconclude by addressing the additional difficulties that one meets when trying\nto extend the construction to chiral four-dimensional models.

In order for the $\\sigma$-model perturbation to be\nrelevant, the level $k$ of the underlying affine algebra has to be negative. We\nprove that in the large $|k|$ limit the perturbed WZNW system with negative $k$\nflows to the conformal WZNW model with positive level. The flow appears to be\nintegrable due to the existence of conserved currents satisfying the Lax\nequation.

Using techniques from the loop\nrepresentation of gauge theory, we construct well-defined substitutes for\n``Lebesgue measure'' on the space A of connections on P and for ``Haar\nmeasure'' on the group Ga of gauge transformations. More precisely, we define\nalgebras of ``cylinder functions'' on the spaces A, Ga, and A/Ga, and define\ngeneralized measures on these spaces as continuous linear functionals on the\ncorresponding algebras. Borrowing some ideas from lattice gauge theory, we\ncharacterize generalized measures on A, Ga, and A/Ga in terms of graphs\nembedded in M. We use this characterization to construct generalized measures\non A and Ga, respectively. The ``uniform'' generalized measure on A is\ninvariant under the group of automorphisms of P. It projects down to the\ngeneralized measure on A/Ga considered by Ashtekar and Lewandowski in the case\nG = SU(n). The ``generalized Haar measure'' on Ga is right- and left-invariant\nas well as Aut(P)-invariant. We show that averaging any generalized measure on\nA against generalized Haar measure gives a gauge-invariant generalized measure\non A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 1993 12:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

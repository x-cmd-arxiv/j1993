At a\nfixed parameter value the corresponding horseshoe represents the set of orbits\ntrapped in the scattering region. The bifurcations are a pure boundary effect\nand no other bifurcations such as saddle center bifurcations occur in this\ntransition scenario. Truncated horseshoes actually arise in concrete potential\nscattering under suitable conditions. It is shown that a simple scattering\nmodel introduced earlier can realize this scenario in a certain parameter range\n(the \"truncated sawshoe\") . For this purpose, we solve the inverse scattering\nproblem of finding the central potential associated to the sawshoe model.\nFurthermore, we review classification schemes for the transition to chaos of\ntruncated horseshoes originating from symbolic dynamics and formal language\ntheory and apply them to the truncated double horseshoe and the truncated\nsawshoe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 1993 18:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

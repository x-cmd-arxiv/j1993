The model shows\nemergent traffic jams with a self-similar appearance near the throughput\nmaximum of the traffic. The lifetime distribution of these jams shows a short\nscaling regime, which gets considerably longer if one reduces the fluctuations\nfor driving at maximum speed but leaves the fluctuations for slowing down or\naccelerating unchanged. The outflow from a traffic jam self-organizes into this\nstate of maximum throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 1993 01:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Because of its simplicity, it is easy to\nimplement the model on supercomputers (vectorizing and parallel), where we have\nachieved real time limits of more than 4~million~kilometers (or more than\n53~million vehicle sec/sec). The model can be used for applications where both\nhigh simulation speed and individual vehicle resolution are needed. We use the\nmodel for extended statistical analysis to gain insight into traffic phenomena\nnear capacity, and we discuss that this model is a good candidate for network\nrouting applications.

In this sense, the Schwinger model is one of the few examples of\ninteracting and nontopological field theories that are possible to quantize on\na Riemann surface. It is also shown here that the Schwinger model is equivalent\nto a nonlocal integrable model which represents a generalization of the\nThirring model. Apart from the possible applications in string theory and\nintegrable models, we hope that this result can be also useful in the study of\nquantum field theories in curved space-times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Oct 1993 17:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-11"}

Here we\nshow how commonly used likelihood function techniques can be generalized to\naccount for foreground. Specifically we set some restrictions on the spectrum\nof foreground contamination but allow the amplitude to vary arbitrarily. The\nlikelihood function thus generalized gives reasonable limits on the MBR\nanisotropy which, in some cases, are not much less restrictive than what one\nwould get from more detailed modeling of the foreground. Furthermore, the\nlikelihood function is exactly the same as one would obtain by simply\nprojecting out foreground contamination and just looking at the reduced data\nset. We apply this generalized analysis to the recent medium angle data sets of\nACME-HEMT and MAX. The resulting analysis constrains the one free parameter in\nthe standard cold dark matter theory to be Q=18_-5^+8 microK. This best fit\nvalue, although in striking agreement with the normalization from COBE, is not\na very good fit, with an overall chi^2/ degree of freedom =208/168. We also\nargue against three commonly used methods of dealing with foreground: (i)\nignoring it completely; (ii) subtracting off a best fit foreground and treating\nthe residuals as if uncontaminated; and (iii) culling data which appears to be\ncontaminated by foreground.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 1993 03:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

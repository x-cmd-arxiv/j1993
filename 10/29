If the evolution is not pointwise in time (as in\nLiouville space), then the decoherence may occur even for closed systems.

The population is described by a Fokker-Planck\nequation for the distribution of phases, and we apply center-manifold reduction\nto obtain the amplitude equations for steady-state and Hopf bifurcation from\nthe equilibrium state with a uniform phase distribution. When the population is\ndescribed by a native frequency distribution that is reflection-symmetric about\nzero, the problem has circular symmetry. In the limit of zero extrinsic noise,\nalthough the critical eigenvalues are embedded in the continuous spectrum, the\nnonlinear coefficients in the amplitude equation remain finite in contrast to\nthe singular behavior found in similar instabilities described by the\nVlasov-Poisson equation. For a bimodal reflection-symmetric distribution, both\ntypes of bifurcation are possible and they coincide at a codimension-two Takens\nBogdanov point. The steady-state bifurcation may be supercritical or\nsubcritical and produces a time-independent synchronized state. The Hopf\nbifurcation produces both supercritical stable standing waves and supercritical\nunstable travelling waves. Previous work on the Hopf bifurcation in a bimodal\npopulation by Bonilla, Neu, and Spigler and Okuda and Kuramoto predicted stable\ntravelling waves and stable standing waves, respectively. A comparison to these\nprevious calculations shows that the prediction of stable travelling waves\nresults from a failure to include all unstable modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 1993 21:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The theory is\nconstructed from a bare Euclidean action which at a scale much greater than the\nparticle's mass is constrained only by the most basic requirements; stability,\nfiniteness, analyticity, naturalness, and global symmetry. We prove to all\norders in perturbation theory the boundedness, convergence, and universality of\nthe theory at low energy scales, and thus that the theory is perturbatively\nrenormalizable in the sense that to a certain precision over a range of such\nscales it depends only on a finite number of parameters. We then demonstrate\nthat the effective theory has a well defined unitary and causal analytic\nS--matrix at all energy scales. We also show that redundant terms in the\nLagrangian may be systematically eliminated by field redefinitions without\nchanging the S--matrix, and discuss the extent to which effective field theory\nand analytic S--matrix theory are actually equivalent. All this is achieved by\na systematic exploitation of Wilson's exact renormalization group flow\nequation, as used by Polchinski in his original proof of the renormalizability\nof conventional $\\varphi^4$-theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 1993 16:09:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 1993 15:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Precisely, the remarkable homogeneous space\nDiff$(S^1)$/$SL(2,R)$ (which is one of the two possible quantizable coadjoint\norbits of Diff$(S^1)$), embeds as a complex analytic and K\\\"ahler submanifold\nof the universal Teichm\\\"uller space.

Confirming the analytic expectations of Richstone,\nLoeb, \\& Turner, we demonstrate that cluster evolution is sensitive to the\ncosmological model in which the clusters form. We further show that\nevolutionary differences are echoed in the gross morphological features of the\ncluster X--ray emission.\n  We examine current--epoch X--ray images of models originating from the same\ninitial density fields evolved in three different cosmologies: (i) an unbiased,\nlow density universe with $\\Omega_o \\se 0.2$; (ii) an unbiased universe\ndominated by vacuum energy with $\\Omega_o \\se 0.2$ and $\\lambda_o \\se 0.8$ and\n(iii) a biased Einstein--deSitter model ($\\Omega \\se 1$, $\\sigma_8=0.59$).\nUsing measures of X--ray morphology such as the axial ratio and centroid\nshifting, we demonstrate that clusters evolved in the two low $\\Omega_o$ models\nare much more regular, spherically symmetric, and centrally condensed than\nclusters evolved in the Einstein--deSitter model. This morphology--cosmology\nconnection, along with the availability of a large body of cluster X--ray\nobservations, makes cluster X--ray morphology both a powerful and a practical\ncosmological discriminant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 1993 21:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Below five dimensions, an epsilon expansion\nfor the stable zero temperature fixed point yields the properties of the glassy\nphase. Transverse to the direction of correlation, the randomness induces\nlogarithmic growth of displacements. Displacements are strongly localized in\nthe correlation direction. The absence of a response to a weak applied\ntransverse field (transverse Meissner effect) is demonstrated analytically. In\nthis simple model, the localized phase is stable to point disorder, in contrast\nto the behavior in the presence of dislocations, in which the converse is\nbelieved to be true.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 1993 20:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The lattice action is `almost' gauge invariant, because a local gauge\ntransformation leaves the action the same, up to a global gauge transformation.\nIn this approach the action $S$ for all gauge fields on a gauge orbit is the\nsame as that of the action $S^\\pr$ evaluated for the gauge field fixed to a\nsmooth gauge. To define $S$ unambiguously, it must be possible to compute the\ngauge fixed field unambiguously. This rules out gauge conditions which suffer\nfrom Gribov ambiguities but it can be achieved by using the recently proposed\nLaplacian gauge. When using the almost gauge invariant action $S$ in a\nnumerical simulation, it is not necessary to fix the gauge, and hence gauge\nfixing terms and Fadeev-Popov ghosts are not required. A hybrid Monte Carlo\nalgorithm for simulations with this new action is described and tested on a\nsimple toy model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 1993 23:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

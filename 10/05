For the allowed hidden sectors, we estimate the running gauge\ncoupling constants making use of threshold corrections due to the higher\nmassive modes. The calculation is important from the viewpoint of gaugino\ncondensations, which is one of the most promissing mechanism to break the\nsupersymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 1993 03:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The\napproach used is that of small perturbations around topologically nontrivial\nclassical solutions $A^I_\\mu$ of the Maxwell equations. The propagator of the\ngauge fields and the form of the fields $A^I_\\mu$ are explicitly computed in\nthe Feynman gauge. Despite of the fact that the quantization procedure\npresented here is mainly perturbative, in the case of the Schwinger model, or\ntwo dimensional quantum electrodynamics, it is also possible to derive\nnonperturbative results. As an example, we show that, at very short distances,\nthe electromagnetic forces on a Riemann surface vanish up to zero modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 1993 14:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

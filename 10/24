The exact expressions for the corresponding\nmetric $G_{\\m\\n}$, antisymmetric tensor $B_{\\m\\n}$, and dilaton $\\phi$ can be\nobtained by eliminating the $2d$ gauge field from the local part of the\neffective action of the gauged WZNW model. We show that there exists a\nmanifestly gauge-invariant prescription for the derivation of the antisymmetric\ntensor coupling. When the subgroup $H$ is one-dimensional and $G$ is simple the\nantisymmetric tensor is given by the semiclassical ($\\alpha'$-independent)\nexpression. We consider in detail the simplest non-trivial example with\nnon-trivial $B_{\\m\\n}$ -- the D=3 sigma model corresponding to the $[SL(2,R) x\nR]/R$ gauged WZNW theory (`charged black string') and show that the exact\nexpressions for $G_{\\m\\n}$, $B_{\\m\\n}$ and $\\phi$ solve the Weyl invariance\nconditions in the two-loop approximation. Similar conclusion is reached for the\nclosely related $SL(2,R)/R$ chiral gauged WZNW model. We find that there exists\na scheme in which the semiclassical background is also a solution of the\ntwo-loop conformal invariance equations (but the tachyon equation takes a\nnon-canonical form).

One of the crucial aspects of density\nperturbations that are produced by the standard inflation scenario is that they\nare Gaussian, whereas seeds produced by topological defects left over from an\nearly cosmic phase transition tend to be non-Gaussian. To carry out this test,\nsophisticated statistical tools are required. In this paper, we will discuss\nseveral such statistical tools, including multivariant skewness and kurtosis,\n  Euler-Poincare characteristics, the three point temperature correlation\nfunction, and the Hotelling's $T^{2}$ statistic defined through bispectral\nestimates of a one dimensional dataset. The effect of noise present in the\ncurrent data is discussed in detail and the COBE 53 GHz dataset is analyzed.\nOur analysis shows that, on the large angular scale to which COBE is sensitive,\nthe statistics are probably Gaussian. On the small angular scales, the\nimportance of Hotelling's $T^{2}$ statistic is stressed, and the minimum sample\nsize required to test Gaussianity is estimated. Although the current dataset\navailable from various experiments at half-degree scales is still too small,\nimprovement of the dataset by roughly a factor of two will be enough to test\nthe Gaussianity statistically. On the arcminute scales, we analyze the recent\nRING data through bispectral analysis, and the result\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 1993 22:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-30"}

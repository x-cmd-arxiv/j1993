For this purpose\nmeson fluctuations off the non--strange soliton are considered. For the kaon\nP--wave channel the emerging Bethe--Salpeter equation is solved yielding the\nbound state energy and wave--function. This kaon bound state also induces a\nstrange valence quark wave--function. Collective coordinates are introduced for\nthe SU(2) isorotations and the coupling of the bound state to these rotations\nis determined. The total spin is decomposed into parts carried by the soliton\nand the bound state. The absolute value of the former is identical to the total\nisospin while the latter is demonstrated to be identical to the expectation\nvalue of the grand spin, the sum of spin and isospin. The functional trace\ninvolves quark states with various grand spins which get polarized by the kaon\nbound state. This polarization results in a normalization of the coupling\nbetween the collective rotation and the bound state different from the Skyrme\nmodel. Nevertheless after quantization the expression for the baryon masses can\nbe cast into the form found by Callan and Klebanov for the Skyrme model.\nNumerical results for the baryon spectrum are compared to those obtained in the\nsame model using the collective approach of Yabu and Ando. It is found that for\n$\\frac{1}{2}^+$ baryons the bound state treatment reproduces the experimental\ndata better than the collective approach while there are only small differences\nbetween the two approaches for the $\\frac{3}{2}^+$ baryons. Both treatments\nunderestimate the mass splittings for baryons with different strangeness.

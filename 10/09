We find that,\nfor strong confining potentials, the edge of a $\\nu=1$ liquid is described by\nthe $Z_F=1$ Fermi Liquid theory, even in the presence of interactions, a\nconsequence of the chiral nature of the system. When the edge confining\npotential is decreased beyond a point, the edge undergoes a reconstruction and\nelectrons start to deposit a distance $\\sim 2$ magnetic lengths away from the\ninitial QH Liquid. Within the Hartree-Fock approximation, a new pair of\nbranches of gapless edge excitations is generated after the transition. We show\nthat the transition is controlled by the balance between a long-ranged\nrepulsive Hartree term and a short-ranged attractive exchange term. Such\ntransition also occurs for Quantum Dots in the Quantum Hall Regime, and should\nbe observable in resonant tunneling experiments. Electron tunneling into the\nreconstructed edge is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 1993 17:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

When the threshold distribution has a lower\ncutoff at a finite value and a power law dependence towards large thresholds\nwith an exponent which is less than $0.16\\pm0.03$, the network is not sensitive\nto the added noise, otherwise it is. The transition between sensitivity or not\nappears to be second order, and is related to a localization-delocalization\ntransition earlier observed in such systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 1993 18:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

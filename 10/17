We consider\nprocesses which provide sensitive probes of the basic ingredients of the model:\nright-handed gauge bosons, right-handed Majorana neutrinos, lepton number\nviolating interactions and triplet Higgs scalars. A supersymmetric version of\nthe left-right model is also studied and some distinctive experimental tests\nfor it is proposed. One of the main messages of this talk is to emphasize the\nusefulness of the collision modes $e^-e^-$, $e^-\\gamma$ and $\\gamma\\gamma$ for\nthe tests of the left-right symmetric model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 1993 14:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

As a consequence of such long relaxation times, a clear departure from\nchemical equilibrium must be observed in the momentum distribution of secondary\nparticles produced in high energy nuclear collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Oct 1993 15:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

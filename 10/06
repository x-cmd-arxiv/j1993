We use tree-level QCD (including\nrelativistic corrections) and the full one-loop potential; nonperturbative\neffects are taken into account at the leading order through the contribution of\nthe gluon condensate <alpha_strong G^2>. We use the values Lambda_QCD= 200\n(+80/-60) MeV and <alpha_s G^2> = 0.042 +/- 0.020 GeV^4, but we trade the value\nof the quark mass by the masses of J/psi, Upsilon as input. We get good\nagreement in what is essentially a zero parameter evaluation for the masses of\nthe 1S, 2S, 2P states of bottomium, the 1S state for charmonium, and the decay\nUpsilon --> e^+ e^-. As outstanding result we obtain the precise determination\nof the bottom quark mass (m_b) as well as an estimate of the hyperfine\nsplitting M(Upsilon)-M(eta_b): m_b(m_b^2) = 4387 (+7/-2) (-3/+4)\n(+16/-32)(systematic) MeV, M(Upsilon)-M(eta_b) = 36 (+13/-7)(+3/-6)\n(+11/-5)(syst.)

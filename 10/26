General results on the\nlocal BRST cohomology allow one to prove that the anomalies appear in the time\ndevelopment of the BRST charge and violate the nilpotency of this charge.\nFurthermore they are equivalent to those of the Lagrangian formalism. The\nanalysis provides a completely gauge and regularisation independent proof of\nFaddeev's conjecture on the relationship between gauge anomalies and Schwinger\nterms in the context of descent equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 1993 14:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We show that,\ncontrary to standard gauging of WZNW models, this gauging is carried out by\nminimally coupling the gauge fields. We find that this gauging, in the case of\ngauging an abelian vector subgroup, differs from the standard one by terms\nproportional to the field strength of the gauge fields. We prove that gauging\nan abelian vector subgroup does not have a nonlinear sigma model\ninterpretation. This is because the target-space metric resulting from the\nintegration over the gauge fields is degenerate. We demonstrate, however, that\nthis kind of gauging has a natural interpretation in terms of Wakimoto\nvariables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 1993 15:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

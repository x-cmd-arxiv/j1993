The model is different from the\nstandard time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau description of the evolution of a\nnon-conserved order parameter and resembles the Swift-Hohenberg model. The\nearly-stage growth kinetics is analyzed and compared to the Cahn-Hilliard\ntheory of continuous ordering. The effects of non-linearities on the growth\nkinetics are discussed qualitatively and it is shown that the presence of an\nunderlying elastic lattice introduces qualitatively new effects. A lattice\nHamiltonian capable of describing these effects and suitable for carrying out\nsimulations of the growth kinetics is also constructed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Oct 1993 17:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

It is argued that in typical cases\ninformation loss implies energy loss, and thus can be thought of in terms of\ncoupling to a spectrum of ``fictitious'' remnants. This suggests proposals for\ninformation loss that do not imply planckian energy fluctuations in the low\nenergy world. However, if consistency of gravity prevents energy\nnon-conservation, these remnants must then be considered to be real. In either\ncase, the catastrophe corresponding to infinite pair production remains a\npotential problem. Using Reissner-Nordstrom black holes as a paradigm for a\ntheory of remnants, it is argued that couplings in such a theory may give\nfinite production despite an infinite spectrum. Evidence for this is found in\nanalyzing the instanton for Schwinger production; fluctuations from the\ninfinite number of states lead to a divergent stress tensor, spoiling the\ninstanton calculation. Therefore naive arguements for infinite production fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Oct 1993 00:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 1993 01:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-11-13"}

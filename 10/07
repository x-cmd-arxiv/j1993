The rate of\ndetection could be consistent with the assumption that these halo objects are\ndistributed with a softened isothermal profile with a core radius of $(2-8)$Kpc\nand asymptotic circular velocity of $220\\kms$. Taken in isolation, this\nobservation is consistent with a universe having only baryonic dark matter\n(BDM, hereafter) contributing $\\Omega_b=\\Omega_{total}\\simeq0.06$ which will,\nhowever, violently contradict several other large scale observations, notably\nthe COBE-DMR results. Alternatively one can assume that galaxies like ours are\nsurrounded by both BDM and non-baryonic dark matter (NBDM, hereafter). A model\nwith a single component for NBDM with, say,\n$\\Omega_b\\simeq0.06,\\Omega_{cdm}\\simeq0.94$, is also ruled out if we demand\nthat: (i) at least thirty percent of the dark matter density within $100$ kpc\nis baryonic and (ii) galactic structures should have collapsed by redshift of\n$z=1$.

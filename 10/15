We have included examples involving 21 frames for which either the\nsky brightness or image resolution varied by a factor of three. The gains in\ns/n were modest for most of the examples, except for DAOFIND detection with\nvarying image resolution which exhibited a substantial s/n increase. Even\nthough the only consideration was maximizing s/n, the image resolution was seen\nto improve for most of the variable resolution examples. Also discussed are\nempirical fits for the weighting and the availability of the program, WEIGHT,\nused to generate the weighting for the individual frames.

The action of the Casimir element, which belongs to the dual\nto ${\\cal A}_q$ quantum group $U_q(SL_2({\\bf C}))$, on some subspace in ${\\bf\nL}_q^3$ in these coordinates leads to a second order difference operator on the\ninfinite one-dimensional lattice. In the continuos limit $q\\rightarrow 1$ it is\ntransformed into the Schr\\\"{o}dinger Hamiltonian, which describes zero modes\ninto the Liouville field theory (the Liouville quantum mechanics). We calculate\nthe spectrum (Brillouin zones) and the eigenfunctions of this operator. They\nare $q$-continuos Hermit polynomials, which are particular case of the\nMacdonald or Rogers-Askey-Ismail polynomials. The scattering in this problem\ncorresponds to the scattering of first two level dressed excitations in the\n$Z_N$ Baxter model in the very peculiar limit when the anisotropy parameter\n$\\ga$ and $N~\\rightarrow\\infty$, or, equivalently, $(\\ga, N)\\rightarrow 0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 1993 17:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

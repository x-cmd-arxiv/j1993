We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)\ntechnique for this purpose. Formation of thick disks are found to be preceded\nby shock waves travelling away from the centrifugal barrier. For a large range\nof the parameter space, the travelling shock settles at a distance close to the\nlocation obtained by a one-and-a-half dimensional model of inviscid accretion\ndisks. Occasionally, it is observed that accretion processes are aided by the\nformation of oblique shock waves, particularly in the initial transient phase.\nThe post-shock region (where infall velocity suddenly becomes very small)\nresembles that of the usual model of thick accretion disk discussed in the\nliterature, though they have considerable turbulence. The flow subsequently\nbecomes supersonic before falling into the black hole. In a large number of\ncases which we simulate, we find the formation of strong winds which are hot\nand subsonic when originated from the disk surface very close to the black hole\nbut become supersonic within a few tens of the Schwarzschild radius of the\nblackhole. In the case of accretion of high angular momentum flow, very little\namount of matter is accreted directly onto the black hole. Most of the matter\nis, however, first squeezed to a small volume close to the black hole, and\nsubsequently expands and is expelled as a strong wind. It is quite possible\nthat this expulsion of matter and the formation of cosmic radio jets is aided\nby the shock heating in the inner parts of the accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Oct 1993 07:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

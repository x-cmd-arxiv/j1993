The analysis simplifies near the\nferromagnetic limit. We find that the two dimensional(2D) Hubbard model has a\ncharge excitation gap at half-filling for any finite U in this region on both\nthe bipartite square lattice and the nonbipartite triangular lattice. In some\ncases, the system goes through a first-order phase transition to become a\nparamagnetic metal as $S_{z}$ is lowered. We also discuss the extension to the\ndoped case. We find that in the large U limit, a single doped hole has a\nbandwidth of order of J rather than t at $S_{z}=0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 1993 19:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

They are\nimportant in the analysis of surface effects and bubble formation in the\nplasma. The vector potential appears non-linearly in the loop; in weak coupling\nthe linear term gives rise to the traditional free energy graphs. But the\nnon-linear terms generate insertions of the constrained modes into the free\nenergy graphs, through renormalisations of the Polyakov loop. These insertions\nare gauge dependent and are necessary to cancel the gauge dependence of the\nfree energy graphs. The latter is shown, through the BRST identities, to have\nagain the form of constrained mode insertions. It also follows, that absolute\nminima of the potential are at the centergroup values of the loop. We evaluate\nthe two-loop contributions for SU(N) gauge theories, with and without quarks,\nfor the full domain of the N-1 variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 1993 18:07:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2009 17:11:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2009 17:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

To distinguish them from systems with limited\ncomputing power, we formulate two simplicity criteria for general dynamical\nsystems, and apply them to unimodal systems on real interval. We say that a\ndynamical system is regular, if it yields a regular language when observed\nthrough arbitrary almost disjoint cover. Finite automata are regarded as\ndynamical systems on zero-dimensional spaces and their factors yield another\nclass of simple dynamical systems. These two criteria coincide on subshifts,\nsince a subshift is regular iff it is a factor of a finite automaton (sofic\nsystems). A unimodal system on real interval is regular if it has only a finite\nnumber of periodic points, and nonrecursive otherwise. On the other hand each\n$S$-unimodal system with finite, periodic or preperiodic kneading sequence is a\nfactor of a finite automaton. Thus preperiodic $S$-unimodal systems are factors\nof finite automata, which are not regular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 1993 13:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

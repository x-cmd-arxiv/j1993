This class contains compactons, which are\nsolitary waves with compact support, and when $l=p+2$, these solutions have the\nfeature that their width is independent of the amplitude. We consider the\nHamiltonian structure and integrability properties of this class of KdV\nequations. We show that many of the properties of the solitary waves and\ncompactons are easily obtained using a variational method based on the\nprinciple of least action. Using a class of trial variational functions of the\nform $u(x,t) = A(t) \\exp \\left[-\\beta (t) \\left|x-q(t) \\right|^{2n} \\right]$ we\nfind soliton-like solutions for all $n$, moving with fixed shape and constant\nvelocity, $c$. We show that the velocity, mass, and energy of the variational\ntravelling wave solutions are related by $ c = 2 r E M^{-1}$, where $ r =\n(p+l+2)/(p+6-l)$, independent of $n$.\\newline \\newline PACS numbers: 03.40.Kf,\n47.20.Ky, Nb, 52.35.Sb\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 May 1993 15:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

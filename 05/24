We\nbuild on and extend the recent work of Christensen, but our conclusion for the\noptimal choice of orientations of a pair of detectors differs from his. For a\npair of detectors (such as LIGO) that subtends an angle at the center of the\nearth of $\\,\\alt 70^\\circ$, we find that the optimal configuration is for each\ndetector to have its arms make an angle of $45^\\circ$ (modulo $90^\\circ$) with\nthe arc of the great circle that joins them. For detectors that are farther\nseparated, each detector should instead have one arm aligned with this arc. We\nalso describe in detail the optimal data-analysis algorithm for searching for\nthe stochastic background with a detector network, which is implicit in earlier\nwork of Michelson.

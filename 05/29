To clarify these issues, we consider a complete\ntreatment of Compton scattering to second order, an approach which may be\napplicable to other astrophysical situations. We find that only the ${\\cal O}\n(v)$ Doppler effect, and the ${\\cal O} (v\\delta)$ Vishniac effect are important\nfor recent last scattering epochs; the ${\\cal O} (v^2)$ Doppler effect is not\nsignificant on any angular scale, and other higher-order effects are completely\nnegligible. However the ${\\cal O}(v^2)$ effect does lead to \\Cy\\ distortions,\nwhich although generally below current constraints, set an unavoidable minimum\nlevel in reionization models. We consider the small-angle approximation for the\nVishniac effect in detail, and show several improvements over previous\ntreatments, particularly for low $\\Omega_0$. For standard cold dark matter\nmodels, the effect of reionization is to redistribute the anisotropies to\narcminute scales; late reionization leads to partially erased primary\nfluctuations and a secondary contribution of comparable magnitude. Using recent\nanisotropy limits from the ATCA experiment, we set new constraints on baryonic\ndark matter models. Stronger constraints are imposed (in second order) upon\nmodels with higher Hubble constant, steeper $n$, and higher density. These\nlimits depend on the specific ionization history assumed, but the factor gained\nby lowering the ionization fraction is generally small, and may be tested by\ncurrently-planned\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 1993 02:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

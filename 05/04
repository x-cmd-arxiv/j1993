As in models with B cells only,\nlocalized states exist in the network with limited numbers of activated clones\nsurrounded by virgin or near-virgin clones. The existence and stability of\nthese localized network states are explored as a function of model parameters.\nAs in previous models that have included antibody, the stability of immune and\ntolerant localized states are shown to depend on the ratio of antibody to B\ncell lifetimes as well as the rate of antibody complex removal. As model\nparameters are varied, localized steady-states can break down via two routes:\ndynamically, into chaotic attractors, or structurally into percolation\nattractors. For a given set of parameters, percolation and chaotic attractors\ncan coexist with localized attractors, and thus there do not exist clear cut\nboundaries in parameter space that separate regions of localized attractors\nfrom regions of percolation and chaotic attractors.

By a suitable gauge choice,\n$Z_{\\Sigma\\times S^{1}}$ is reduced to the partition function of an Abelian\ntopological field theory on $\\Sigma$ (a deformation of non-Abelian BF and\nYang-Mills theory) whose evaluation is straightforward. This relates the\nVerlinde formula to the Ray-Singer torsion of $\\Sigma\\times S^{1}$. We derive\nthe $G_{k}/G_{k}$ model from Chern-Simons theory, proving their equivalence,\nand give an alternative derivation of the Verlinde formula by calculating the\n$G_{k}/G_{k}$ path integral via a functional version of the Weyl integral\nformula. From this point of view the Verlinde formula arises from the\ncorresponding Jacobian, the Weyl determinant. Also, a novel derivation of the\nshift $k\\ra k+h$ is given, based on the index of the twisted Dolbeault complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 May 1993 13:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 May 1993 08:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

On the classical side, the\ngeneralized symplectic reduction procedure of Mikami and Weinstein, as further\nextended by Xu in connection with symplectic equivalence bimodules and Morita\nequivalence of Poisson manifolds, is rewritten so as to avoid the use of\nsymplectic groupoids, whose quantum analogue is unknown. A theorem on\nsymplectic reduction in stages is given. This allows one to discern that the\n`quantization' of the generalized moment map consists of an operator-valued\ninner product on a (pre-) Hilbert space (that is, a structure similar to a\nHilbert $C^*$-module). Hence Rieffel's far-reaching operator-algebraic\ngeneralization of the notion of an induced representation is seen to be the\nexact quantum counterpart of the classical idea of symplectic reduction, with\nimprimitivity bimodules and strong Morita equivalence of $C^*$-algebras falling\nin the right place. Various examples involving groups as well as groupoids are\ngiven, and known difficulties with both Dirac and BRST quantization are seen to\nbe absent in our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 1993 15:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Such patterns\nnaturally develop in bistable and excitable systems, but may also appear far\nbeyond Hopf and Turing bifurcations. The global behavior of domain patterns\nstrongly depends on the fronts' inner structures. In this paper we study a\nsymmetry breaking front bifurcation expected to occur in a wide class of\nreaction-diffusion systems, and the effects it has on pattern formation and\npattern dynamics. We extend previous works on this type of front bifurcation\nand clarify the relations among them. We show that the appearance of front\nmultiplicity beyond the bifurcation point allows the formation of persistent\npatterns rather than transient ones. In a different parameter regime, we find\nthat the front bifurcation outlines a transition from oscillating (or\nbreathing) patterns to traveling ones. Near a boundary we find that fronts\nbeyond the bifurcation can reflect, while those below it either bind to the\nboundary or disappear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 May 1993 05:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Formally, it is possible to construct a de Sitter invariant\nstate for this case provided that the zero mode of the field is quantized\nproperly. Here we take the point of view that this state is physically\nacceptable, in the sense that physical observables can be computed and have a\nreasonable interpretation. In particular, we use this vacuum to derive a new\nresult: that the squared difference between the field at two points along a\ngeodesic observer's space-time path grows linearly with the observer's proper\ntime for a quantum state that does not break de Sitter invariance. Also, we use\nthe Hadamard formalism to compute the renormalized expectation value of the\nenergy momentum tensor, both in the O(4) invariant states introduced by Allen\nand Follaci, and in the de Sitter invariant vacuum. We find that the vacuum\nenergy density in the O(4) invariant case is larger than in the de Sitter\ninvariant case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 May 1993 17:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We will show that the equation of\nstate is not modified by topological effects and so the dynamics of the\nuniverse remains as it is in the infinite volume limit. On the contrary the\nthermal history of the universe depends on terms that are associated with\nhaving non-trivial topology. In the conclusions we discuss some issues about\nthe relationship between the $c=1$ non-critical string-inspired cosmology and\nthe result obtained with matter given by a hot massless field in $S^{1}\\times\n\\mbox{\\bf\n  R}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 May 1993 17:20:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 May 1993 15:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

The Boltzmann weights of the lattice models are related\nin the extreme ultra violet limit to the braiding matrices of the rational\nconformal field theory. In this note we use these new lattice models to\nconstruct a link invariant for any such pair of an RCFT and a field in it.\nUsing the properties of RCFT and the IRF lattice models, we prove that the\ninvariants so constructed always obey the Markov properties, and thus are true\nlink invariants. Further, all the known link invariants, such as the Jones,\nHOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials arise in this way, along with giving a host of\nnew invariants, and thus also a unified approach to link polynomials. It is\nspeculated that all link invariants arise from some RCFT, and thus the problem\nof classifying link and knot invariants is equivalent to that of classifying\ntwo dimensional conformal field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 May 1993 11:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

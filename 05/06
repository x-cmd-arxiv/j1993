In this paper we use minimal model theory to link birational\nmaps of log surfaces (log contractions) to equidimensional fibrations of\nelliptic threefolds. As a corollary we show that an elliptic fibration of\npositive Kodaira dimension has a minimal model with an equidimensional\nbirationally equivalent elliptic fibration satisfying certain good properties\nthat naturally generalize the case of elliptic fibrations of surfaces.

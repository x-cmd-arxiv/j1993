The three point correlation\nfunction of the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background\nradiation (CBR) provides a sensitive test of this aspect of the primordial\ndensity field. In this paper, this function is calculated in the general\ncontext of various allowed non-Gaussian models. It is shown that by COBE and\nthe forthcoming South Pole and Balloon CBR anisotropy data may be able to test\nprovide a crucial test of Gaussianity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 1993 03:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In both phases clusters of like spins are observed with\nirregular boundaries. In the ordered phase the two different non-favored spins\nare found to attract each other with a long but finite range. As a result, the\nneighborhoods of the non-favored spins are interpreted as domains of the\ndisordered phase. This explains why the first-order phase transitions\nassociated with the global \\(Z_3\\) symmetry, including the SU(3) pure-gauge\none, are so weak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 May 1993 13:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

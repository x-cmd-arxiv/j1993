C+HDM with linear bias\nfactor $b=1.5$ is consistent both with the COBE data and with the galaxy\ncorrelations we calculate.

These measures define link invariants, or more\ngenerally multiloop invariants; as noted by Witten, the Chern-Simons path\nintegral gives rise to the Jones polynomial, while in quantum gravity this\nobservation is the basis of the loop representation due to Rovelli and Smolin.\nHere we review recent work on making these ideas mathematically rigorous, and\ngive a rigorous construction of diffeomorphism-invariant measures on the space\nof connections modulo gauge transformations generalizing the recent work of\nAshtekar and Lewandowski. This construction proceeds by doing lattice gauge\ntheory on graphs analytically embedded in the base manifold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 1993 18:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We\ninclude nucleon--nucleon interactions by using simple parametrizations of\nrealistic forces, and include electrons and muons in $\\beta$--equilibrium. The\nconditions under which kaon condensed cores undergo a transition to quark\nmatter containing strange quarks are also established. The critical density for\nkaon condensation lies in the range (2.3--5.0)$~\\rho_0$, where\n$\\rho_0=0.16$~fm$^{-3}$ is the equilibrium density of nuclear matter. For too\nlarge a value of the strangeness content of the proton, matter with a kaon\ncondensate is not sufficiently stiff to support the lower limit of $1.44\nM_\\odot$ for a neutron star. Kaon condensation dramatically increases the\nproton abundance of matter and even allows positrons to exist inside the core.\nWe also consider the case when neutrinos are trapped in the matter. Neutrino\ntrapping shifts both kaon condensation and the quark matter transition to\nhigher densities than in the case of cold, catalyzed matter. A newly--formed\nneutron star is expected to have a rather low central density, the density\nrising only after mass accretion onto the star ends after a few seconds. Thus,\nit is likely that if kaon condensation and/or the quark--hadron phase\ntransition occur, they do so only during or after the mass accretion and\nneutrino trapping stages. We suggest that neutrino observations from a galactic\nsupernova may provide direct evidence for or against a condensate and/or a\nquark--hadron transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 May 1993 16:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

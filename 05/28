Starting from the usual point particle action in the\nfirst order formalism, we introduce auxiliary variables which make the action\nlocally Poincar\\'e invariant. A Hamiltonian analysis shows that the gauge group\nis actually larger than the Poincar\\'e group -- certain additional gauge\nconstraints are present which act on the matter degrees of freedom. These\nadditional constraints are necessary to mimic the diffeomorphism invariance\npresent if the theory is formulated with a spacetime metric. The additional\ngauge constraints are realized projectively in the quantum theory, with a phase\nin the composition law for finite gauge transformations. That phase is\nresponsible for the braid invariance of physical observables (holonomies).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 May 1993 20:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

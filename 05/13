Possible choices of the rigid gauge field\nconfiguration corresponding to a nonvanishing static colormagnetic field in the\n\"body fixed\" frame are discussed. A gauge invariant variational equation is\nderived in this frame. For large number N of colors the rigid gauge field\nconfiguration is regarded as random with maximally random probability\ndistribution under constraints on macroscopic--like quantities. For the uniform\nmagnetic field the joint probability distribution of the field components is\ndetermined by maximizing the appropriate entropy under the area law constraint\nfor the Wilson loop. In the quark sector the gauge invariance requires the\nrigid gauge field configuration to appear not only as a background but also as\ninducing an instantaneous quark-quark interaction. Both are random in the large\nN limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 May 1993 09:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

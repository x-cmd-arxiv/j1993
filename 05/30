The one loop amplitude\nfor ($ w^{+} w^{-} \\rightarrow \\overline{t} t $) is calculated for the standard\nmodel and extended technicolour theory. Techni-rho meson exchange is also\nbriefly discussed.\n  We find at $m_{t} = 150 ~GeV$ the cross section of top pair production in $\ne^{+} e^{-}$ collisions is comparable in order of magnitude to that of the\nlongitudinal gauge boson scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 May 1993 17:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 1993 16:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

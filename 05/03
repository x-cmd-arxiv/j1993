Demanding that a state in the black hole be well\nbehaved at the horizon implies that it must tend asymptotically to a\ncombination of a Seiberg and an anti-Seiberg c=1 state. For such a state to be\nwell behaved asymptotically, it must satisfy the condition that neither its\nSeiberg nor its anti-Seiberg Liouville momentum is positive. Thus, although the\nfree-field BRST cohomologies of the underlying SL(2,R)/U(1) theory is the same\nas that of a c=1 theory, the black hole spectrum is drastically truncated:\nTHERE ARE NO W_INFINITY STATES, AND ONLY TACHYONS WITH X-MOMENTA | P_TACH | <=\n| M_TACH | ARE ALLOWED.

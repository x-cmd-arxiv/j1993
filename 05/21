There is a well-known\ninjective map which identifies any CA-invariant subshift with a central formal\nlanguage. However, in the special case of a symbolic dynamics, i.e. where the\nCA is just the shift map, one gets a stronger result: the identification map\ncan be extended to a functor between the categories of symbolic dynamics and\nformal languages. This functor additionally maps topological conjugacies\nbetween subshifts to empty-string-limited generalized sequential machines\nbetween languages. If the periodic points form a dense set, a case which arises\nin a commonly used notion of chaotic dynamics, then an even more natural map to\nassign a formal language to a subshift is offered. This map extends to a\nfunctor, too. The Chomsky hierarchy measuring the complexity of formal\nlanguages can be transferred via either of these functors from formal languages\nto symbolic dynamics and proves to be a conjugacy invariant there. In this way\nit acquires a dynamical meaning. After reviewing some results of the complexity\nof CA-invariant subshifts, special attention is given to a new kind of\ninvariant subshift: the trapped set, which originates from the theory of\nchaotic scattering and for which one can study complexity transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 May 1993 10:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

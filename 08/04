To avoid that difficulty the problem is solved within the\nframework of the Galilean spin-1/2 wave equation which is free of that\nparticular complication.\n  It is then found that the singular solutions can be eliminated provided that\nthe nongauge potential is made energy dependent. The effect of the inclusion of\na Coulomb potential is also considered with the result being that the range of\nflux parameter for which singular solutions are allowed is only half as great\nas in the pure Aharonov-Bohm limit. Expressions are also obtained for the\nbinding energies which can occur in the combined Aharonov-Bohm-Coulomb system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Aug 1993 19:34:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 1993 17:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

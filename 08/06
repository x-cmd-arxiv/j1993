Viewing this classical system as a constrained system on the group\nG, we show that these inequivalent quantizations can be recovered from a\ngeneralization of Dirac's approach to the quantization of such a constrained\nsystem within which the classical first class constraints (generating the\nH-action on G) are allowed to become anomalous (second class) when quantizing.\nThe resulting quantum theories are characterized by the emergence of a\nYang-Mills connection, with quantized couplings, and new 'spin' degrees of\n{}freedom. Various applications of this procedure are presented in detail:\nincluding a new account of how spin can be described within a path-integral\nformalism, and how on S^4 chiral spin degrees of {}freedom emerge, coupled to a\nBPST instanton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 1993 15:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

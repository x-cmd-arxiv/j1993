In each case\nthe stream lines pass through a thick accretion torus, which is better thought\nof as a standing pressure wave rather than as a relatively inert Keplerian\nstructure.We base our arguments on a simple analytic example,which is topologi\ncally generic,wherein each bipolarmode is created by the rebound of accreting\nmatter under the action of the thermal,magnetic,turbulent and centrifugal\npressures created in the flow. In both bipolar modes the presence of non-zero\nangular momentum implies axial regions wherein the pressure is first reduced\nbelow the value at infinity and then becomes negative, where the solution fails\nbecause rotating material can not enter this region without suction.The model\nthus has empty stems where the activity of the central source must dominate.So\nthe basic engine of the bipolar flow discussed here is simply the rebound of\nfreely falling material from a thick pressure disc into an axial low pressure\nregion.The low mass,high velocity outflow must be produced in this region by an\nadditional mechanism. This is reminiscent of the cored apple structure observed\nrecently in the very young bipolar source VLA 1623.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 1993 00:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

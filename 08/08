We find that the two-photon\ncorrelation function strongly depends not only on the space-time properties of\nthe collision region but also on the dynamics of the proton-neutron scattering\nprocess in nuclear matter. As a consequence of polarisation correlations it\nturns out that for a purely chaotic source the intercept of the correlation\nfunction of photons can reach the value $3$ (as compared with the maximum value\n$2$ for isotropic systems). Furthermore even for ``hard\" photons ($E_{\\gamma} >\n25 MeV$) the maximum of the correlation function can reach the value of $2$ in\ncontrast with the value of $1.5$ derived by Neuhauser for this case. The\nformulae obtained in this paper which include also the possible presence of a\ncoherent component can be used as a basis for a systematic analysis of photon\nintensity-interferometry experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Aug 1993 13:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

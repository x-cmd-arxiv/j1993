The atomic\nnuclei are supposed to be in thermal equilibrium with the ambient plasma. The\nmajority of reactions among nuclei leading to a nuclear transformation are\ninhibited by the necessity for the charged participants to tunnel through their\nmutual Coulomb barrier. As theoretical knowledge and experimental verification\nof nuclear cross sections increases it becomes possible to refine analytic\nrepresentations for nuclear reaction rates. Over the years various approaches\nhave been made to derive closed-form representations of thermonuclear reaction\nrates (Critchfield 1972, Haubold and John 1978, Haubold, Mathai and Anderson\n1987). They show that the reaction rate contains the astrophysical cross\nsection factor and its derivatives which has to be determined experimentally,\nand an integral part of the thermonuclear reaction rate independent from\nexperimental results which can be treated by closed-form representation\ntechniques in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions. In this paper\nmathematical/statistical techniques for deriving closed-form representations of\nthermonuclear functions will be summarized and numerical results for them will\nbe given. The separation of thermonuclear functions from thermonuclear reaction\nrates is our preferred result. The purpose of the paper is also to compare\nnumerical results for approximate and closed-form representations of\nthermonuclear functions.

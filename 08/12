This trace is known to approach unity as $t\n\\rightarrow \\infty$ for bound systems. It is written as the Fourier transform\nof the logaritmic derivative of a zeta function whose zeros are identified with\nthe eigenvalues of the operator. Zeta functions are expected to be entire only\nfor very specific systems, like Axiom-A systems. For bound chaotic systems\ncomplications arise due to e.g. intermittency and non completeness of the\nsymbolic dynamics. For bound intermittent system an approximation of the zeta\nfunction is derived. It is argued that bound systems with {\\em long time tails}\nhave branch cuts in the zeta function and traces approaching unity as a\npowerlaw. Another feature of bound chaotic systems, relevant for the\nasymptotics of the trace, is that the dominant time scale can be much longer\nthan the period of the shortest periodic orbit. This the case for e.g. the\nhyperbola billiard. Isolated zeros of the zeta function for the hyperbola\nbilliard are evaluated by means of a cycle expansion. Crucial for the success\nof this approach is the identification of a sequence of periodic orbit\nresponsible for a logarithmic branch cut in the zeta function. Semiclassical\nimplications are discussed at the end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 1993 08:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

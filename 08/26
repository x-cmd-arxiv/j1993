Conservation laws for an entraining\nrelativistic jet are derived and are used to determine a relationship between\nMach number and velocity for initially relativistic jets. One immediate\nconsequence of this relationship is that, if an initially relativistic jet is\ndecelerated to a transonic Mach number between, say 0.5 and 1.5, then its\nvelocity at this point is between 0.3 and 0.7 times the speed of light.\nAnalysis of the milliarcsecond and arcsecond data on NGC~315 and NGC~6251 shows\nthat the Lorentz factors of the core jets in these galaxies can be as high as\n2-4 provided that the jet pressures are not much more than an order of\nmagnitude higher than the minimum pressures. Such Lorentz factors are more\nplausible if the jets are inclined at $\\sim 30$ degrees to the line of sight,\nalthough larger angles would also be possible. For core Lorentz factors in the\nrange 2-4, the jets are mildly relativistic on the large scale and their\nvelocities are consistent with the jet brightness asymmetries being caused by\nDoppler beaming. The Lorentz factors required for significant beaming of core\njets may be reconciled with subluminal motions of knots in the core if these\nare reverse shocks advected by the jet. Moderate jet Lorentz factors are\npossible if the shocks are normal and higher Lorentz factors are possible if\nthe shocks are oblique.

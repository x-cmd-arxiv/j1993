This new\ncluster has a high density of vec k points along the diagonal of reciprocal\nspace, viz. along k = (k,k). The results clearly demonstrate that when the\nsingle hole problem has a ground state with a system momentum of vec k =\n(pi/2,pi/2), the resulting ground state for N holes involves a shift of the\npeak of the system's structure factor away from the antiferromagnetic state.\nThis shift effectively increases continuously with N. When the single hole\nproblem has a ground state with a momentum that is not equal to k =\n(pi/2,pi/2), then the above--mentioned incommensurability for N holes is not\nfound. The results for the incommensurate ground states can be understood in\nterms of rigid--band filling: the effective occupation of the single hole k =\n(pi/2,pi/2) states is demonstrated by the evaluation of the single particle\nmomentum distribution function <n(q)>. Unlike many previous studies, we show\nthat for the many hole ground state the occupied momentum states are indeed k =\n(+/- pi/2,+/- pi/2) states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 1993 18:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

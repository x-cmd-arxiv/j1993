We compare the neutral hydrogen\ncontent of the sample to the blue luminosity and IRAS fluxes. The \\HI-to-blue-\nlight ratios of the confirmed and probable polar rings are around unity in\nsolar units, indicating that polar ring galaxies (or their environments) are as\ngas-rich as typical irregular galaxies. For their blue luminosity, the\nconfirmed polar rings are underluminous in the far-infrared, as compared with\nthe rest of the sample. They are also FIR-underluminous for their \\HI\\ masses,\nwhich suggests that most of the gas in the ring may be in stable orbits, rather\nthan flowing inward to trigger star formation in the central galaxy.

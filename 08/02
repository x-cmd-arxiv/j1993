Several\nauthors noted that the derived equations are not Lorentz covariant and so are\nnot the standard Maxwell theory. In particular, Hojman and Shepley proved that\nthe existence of commutation relations is a strong assumption, sufficient to\ndetermine the corresponding action, which for Feynman's derivation is of\nNewtonian form. Tanimura generalized Feynman's derivation to a Lorentz\ncovariant form, however, this derivation does not lead to the standard Maxwell\ntheory either. Tanimura's force equation depends on a fifth ({\\it scalar})\nelectromagnetic potential, and the invariant evolution parameter cannot be\nconsistently identified with the proper time of the particle motion. Moreover,\nthe derivation cannot be made reparameterization invariant; the scalar\npotential causes violations of the mass-shell constraint which this invariance\nshould guarantee. In this paper, we examine Tanimura's derivation in the\nframework of the proper time method in relativistic mechanics, and use the\ntechnique of Hojman and Shepley to study the unconstrained commutation\nrelations. We show that Tanimura's result then corresponds to the\nfive-dimensional electromagnetic theory previously derived from a\nStueckelberg-type quantum theory in which one gauges the invariant parameter in\nthe proper time method. This theory provides the final step in Feynman's\nprogram of deriving the Maxwell theory from commutation relations; the Maxwell\ntheory emerges as the ``correlation limit'' of a more general gauge theory, in\nwhich it is properly contained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 1993 11:40:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 1995 07:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

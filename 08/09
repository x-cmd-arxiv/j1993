In standard perturbation theory it can be shown\nthat a circular orbit will precess about the minor axis if its angular momentum\nvector lies in a region bounded by two great circles which pass through the\nintermediate axis and which are inclined with minimum separation $i_T$ from the\nminor axis. We test the accuracy of the standard formula for $i_T$ by\nperforming orbit integrations to determine $i_S$, the simulated turnover angle\ncorresponding to $i_T$. We reach two principal conclusions: (i) $i_S$ is\nusually greater than $i_T$, by as much as 12 degrees even for moderate\ntriaxialities, $A/1.2<B<C/0.8$. This reduces the expected frequency of polar\nrings. (ii) $i_S$ is not a single, well-defined number but can vary by a few\ndegrees depending upon the initial phase of the orbit. This means that there is\na reasonable probability for capture of gas onto orbits which precess about\nboth axes. Interactions can then lead to substantial loss of angular momentum\nand subsequent infall to the galactic centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 1993 10:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

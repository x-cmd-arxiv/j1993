To explore these changes, we derive from first principles\nthe equations governing anisotropies, focusing on the interactions of photons\nwith electrons. Vishniac (1987) claimed that second order terms can be large in\na re-ionized Universe, so we derive equations correct to second order in the\nperturbations. There are many more second order terms than were considered by\nVishniac. To understand the basic physics involved, we present a simple\nanalytic approximation to the first order equation. Then turning to the sec-\nond order equation, we show that the Vishniac term is indeed the only important\none. We also present numerical results for a variety of ionization histories\n[in a standard cold dark matter Universe] and show quantitatively how the sig-\nnal in several experiments depends on the ionization history. The most\npronounced indication of a re-ionized Universe would be seen in very small\nscale experiments; the expected signal in the Owens Valley experiment is\nsmaller by a factor of order ten if the last scattering surface is at a\nredshift $z\\simeq100$ as it would be if the Universe were re-ionized very\nearly. On slightly larger scales, the expected signal in a re-ionized Universe\n{\\it is} smaller than it would be with standard recombination, but only by a\nfactor of two or so.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 1993 15:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We\nseparate the local from the global part of the dynamics by defining a train of\ncausal growth events, or \"avalanche\", which can be ascribed a well-defined\ndynamical exponent $z_{loc} = 1 + \\zeta_c \\simeq 1.63$ where $\\zeta_c$ is the\nroughness exponent of the interface.

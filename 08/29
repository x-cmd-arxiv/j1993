These predictions depend on the effective supersymmetric threshold scale\n$T_{SUSY}$, which is only very slightly dependent on the squark and slepton\nmasses, and strongly dependent on the Higgsino masses as well as on the mass\nratio of the gauginos of the strong and weak interactions. Within the minimal\nsupersymmetry breaking scheme and for supersymmetric masses below or of the\norder of 1 TeV, I obtain $\\alpha_3(M_Z) \\geq 0.116$, while, if the running\nbottom quark mass at the physical mass is constrained to be $ m_b(M_b) \\leq 4.1\n$GeV, then, for moderate values of $\\tan \\beta$, perturbative unification is\nachieved only if $\\alpha_3(M_Z) \\leq 0.124$.

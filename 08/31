Our\nmain result is the existence of a \"magic\" power $p_m=3+2\\sqrt{2}$. In\nspacetimes with $p<p_m$ a circular string expands either forever or to a\nmaximal radius and then contracts until it collapses into a point (black hole).\nFor $p>p_m$, however, we find additional types of solutions. They include\nconfigurations which contract from a positive initial radius to a minimal one\nand then expand forever. Their existence we interpret as an indication for the\npresence of a finite potential barrier. Equivalently the new solutions signal\nstring nucleation and tunneling, phenomena recently shown to occur in de Sitter\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 1993 10:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

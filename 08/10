Our\nmethod applies directly to a smoothed mass density field or to the divergence\nof a smoothed peculiar velocity field, provided that rms fluctuations are small\ncompared to unity on the smoothing scale, and that the primordial fluctuations\nthat seed the growth of structure are Gaussian. We use this `Edgeworth\napproximation' to compute the evolution of $<\\delta|\\delta|>$ and $<|delta|>$;\nthese measures are similar to the skewness and kurtosis of the density field,\nbut they are less sensitive to tails of the probability distribution, so they\nmay be more accurately estimated from surveys of limited volume. We compare our\nanalytic calculations to cosmological N-body simulations in order to assess\ntheir range of validity. When $\\sigma \\ll 1$, the numerical simulations and\nperturbation theory agree precisely, demonstrating that the N-body method can\nyield accurate results in the regime of weakly non-linear clustering.

By an\noperator space, we mean a closed subspace $E\\subset B(H)$, with $H$ Hilbert.\n  We will be mainly concerned here with the ``geometry'' of {\\it finite\ndimensional\\/} operator spaces. In the Banach space category, it is well known\nthat every separable space embeds isometrically into $\\ell_\\infty$. Moreover,\nif $E$ is a finite dimensional normed space then for each $\\vp>0$, there is an\ninteger $n$ and a subspace $F\\subset \\ell^n_\\infty$ which is\n$(1+\\vp)$-isomorphic to $E$, i.e. there is an isomorphism $u\\colon \\ E\\to F$\nsuch that $\\|u\\|\\ \\|u^{-1}\\|\\le 1+\\vp$. Here of course, $n$ depends on $\\vp$,\nsay $n=n(\\vp)$ and usually (for instance if $E = \\ell^k_2$) we have $n(\\vp)\\to\n\\infty$ when $\\vp\\to 0$.\n  Quite interestingly, it turns out that this fact is not valid in the category\nof operator spaces:\\ although every operator space embeds completely\nisometrically into $B(H)$ (the non-commutative analogue of $\\ell_\\infty$) it is\nnot true that a finite dimensional operator space must be close to a subspace\nof $M_n$ (the non-commutative analogue of $\\ell^n_\\infty$) for some $n$. The\nmain object of this paper is to study this phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 1993 17:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

The Drinfeld-Sokolov (DS) reduction scheme\nis generalized to arbitrary $sl_2$ embeddings thus showing that a large class\nof W algebras can be viewed as reductions of affine Lie algebras. The\nhierarchies of integrable evolution equations associated to these classical W\nalgebras are constructed as well as the generalized Toda field theories which\nhave them as Noether symmetry algebras. The problem of quantising the DS\nreductions is solved for arbitrary $sl_2$ embeddings and it is shown that any W\nalgebra can be embedded into an affine Lie algebra. This also provides us with\nan algorithmic method to write down free field realizations for arbitrary W\nalgebras. Just like affine Lie algebras W algebras have finite underlying\nstructures called `finite W algebras'. We study the classical and quantum\ntheory of these algebras, which play an important role in the theory of\nordinary W algebras, in detail as well as some aspects of their representation\ntheory. The symplectic leaves (or W-coadjoint orbits) associated to arbitrary\nfinite W algebras are determined as well as their realization in terms of\nbosoic oscillators. Apart from these technical aspects we also review the\npotential applications of W symmetry to string theory, 2-dimensional critical\nphenomena, the quantum Hall effect and solitary wave phenomena.

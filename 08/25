The\nassumptions upon which the operator search and resulting predictions are based\nare stressed, together with a discussion of how the predictions are affected by\na relaxation of some of the assumptions.The masses of the heaviest generation,\n$m_t,m_b$ and $m_\\tau$, are generated from a single renormalizable Yukawa\ninteraction, while the lighter masses and the mixing angles are generated by\nnon-renormalizable operators of the grand unified theory.

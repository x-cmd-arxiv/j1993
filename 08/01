In this paper, we present a method by which\nbacktrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this\ndifficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed\nbacktracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful\ncontrol information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by\nearlier approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 1993 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

In a market-oriented programming approach\nto distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource\nallocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive\nequilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for\ndefining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their\ncorresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach\nfor a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of\nthe decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient\ndistributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be\nmeaningfully analyzed in economic terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 1993 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The observed objects include a complete X-ray flux limited\nsample drawn from the EMS Survey. The majority of the XSBLs classi- fied solely\non the appearance of their spectra are members of the class of BL~Lacs since\nthey possess intrinsically polarized and variable continua. The duty cycle of\npolarized emission from XSBLs is 40\\%. The majority of XSBLs ($\\approx 85$\\%)\nhave preferred polarization position angles on time scales as long as three\nyears. This reflects stability in the geometry of the region emitting the\npolarized optical emission. We discuss the observed spectral dependence of the\ndegree of polarization and some of the possible mechanisms for producing the\nobserved characteristics. While dilution of the polarized emission by the host\ngalaxy starlight is present in some objects, we demon- strate that the average\npolarization properties derived from our observations are not drastically\naffected by this effect. The objects in our monitored sample did not display\nthe larger than one magnitude variations generally used to characterize the\noptical variability of blazars in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 1993 16:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Also considered\nis the spontaneous nucleation of strings, domain walls and monopoles during\ninflation. The instantons for these processes are spherical world-sheets or\nworld-lines embedded in flat or de Sitter backgrounds.

We sug-\ngest a prescription for obtaining the distribution of objects nucleated during\ninflation. This can be seen as an extension of the usual formula, valid in flat\nspace, according to which the nucleation rate is twice the imaginary part of\nthe free energy. In addition, we use the method of Bogolubov transformations to\ncompute the rate of pair production by an electric field in 1+1 dimensional de\nSitter space, and compare the results to those obtained using the instanton me-\nthod. Both results agree where they are expected to, not only in the exponen-\ntial dependence but also in the prefactor, confirming the validity of instanton\ntechniques in de Sitter space.

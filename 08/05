Instead of directly sampling the phase space at\nthe end of the linear era, we first compute the evolution of the metric\nperturbations by numerically integrating the coupled, linearized Einstein,\nBoltzmann, and fluid equations for all particle species. We then sample the\nphase space shortly after neutrino decoupling at redshift z=10^9 when the\ndistribution is Fermi-Dirac. To follow the trajectory of each neutrino, we\nsubsequently integrate the geodesic equations for each neutrino in the\nperturbed background spacetime from z=10^9 to z=13.55, using the linearized\nmetric found in the previous calculation to eliminate discreteness noise. The\npositions and momenta resulting from this integration represent a fair sample\nof the full neutrino phase space and can be used as HDM initial conditions for\nN-body simulations of nonlinear structure evolution in this model.

Attention is\npaid to the translational invariance of the theory. Our approach is centered on\nthe concept of spectral amplitude, a function in the Dirac spinor space. We\nderive a Lorentz covariant equation for the latter, which requires as an input\nthe baryon self-energy. For this we either postulate the most general\nLorentz-Poincar\\'e invariant expression or perform a calculation via a\nBethe-Salpeter equation starting from a nucleon-nucleus interaction. We discuss\nthe features of the nuclear spectrum obtained in the first instance. Finally\nthe general constraints the self-energy should satisfy because of analyticity\nand Poincar\\'e covariance are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Aug 1993 11:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

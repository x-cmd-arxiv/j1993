It is found that the background characteristics,\ntypical for chaotic systems, strongly affects the fluctuation properties of the\nstrength distribution. In particular, the small components of the wave function\nobey a scaling law analogous to self-organized systems at the critical state.\nThis appears to be consistent with the Porter-Thomas distribution of the\ntransition strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Dec 1993 21:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

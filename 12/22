The line strengths of two Fe lines at 5270\nand 5335 A are weaker than one expects from the strength of the Mg b line if\n[Mg/Fe] = 0. We have synthesized absorption line indices to derive the Mg and\nFe abundances of these galaxies. For these models we have calculated new\nevolutionary tracks of high metallicity stars with a range of Mg/Fe abundances.\nThis is the first time that such tracks have been generated. Integrating along\nisochrones to synthesize metal line strengths we find that for a typical bright\ngiant elliptical [Mg/Fe] has to be between +0.3 and +0.7. We show that this\nresult is independent of other parameters such as age, total metal content and\nmixing length parameter. The total metal content is super-solar, but the iron\nmetallicity of elliptical galaxies not necessarily has to be larger than solar.\nFor the formation of elliptical galaxies our result on the Mg and Fe abundances\nhas the implication that most of the enrichment of the gas has to come from SNe\nII, which have more massive progenitors and as such produce relatively more O\nand Mg than Fe. It means that most of the stars have to be formed within a\nperiod of $3 \\times 10^8$ years, so that there can only be one major collapse\nphase of the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 1993 16:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that for most binaries,\nenergy is exchanged quasi-periodically, with the system regulating itself so\nthat the maximum tidal energy always remains small, and no circularization\ntakes place. In contrast, for a range of eccentricities and periastron\nseparations, {\\it chaotic} behaviour prevails, with the eccentricity following\na random walk and with the energy transferred to the tides during a single\nperiastron passage being up to an order of magnitude larger than that\ntransferred during the initial periastron passage.\n  These results have important consequences for the study of tidal capture\nbinaries.

The euclidean sections of these solutions can be\ninterpreted as instantons describing the pair creation of extremal black\nholes/Kaluza-Klein monopoles in a magnetic field. The action of these\ninstantons is calculated and found to agree with the Schwinger result in the\nweak field limit. For the euclidean Ernst solution, the action for the extremal\nsolution differs from that of the previously discussed wormhole instanton by\nthe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

We address the problem of the nature of\nthe very soft component, and whether it can be due to a hot interstellar medium\n(ISM), or is most likely originated by the collective emission of very soft\nstellar sources. To this purpose, hydrodynamical evolutionary sequences for the\nsecular behavior of gas flows in ellipticals have been performed, and the\nresults are compared with the observational X-ray data: the very soft component\ncould be entirely explained with a hot ISM only in galaxies where the depth of\nthe potential well is quite shallow, otherwise the softest contribution to the\nX-ray emission comes certainly from stellar sources. As stellar soft X-ray\nemitters, we consider late-type stellar corone, supersoft sources such as those\ndiscovered by ROSAT in the Magellanic Clouds and M31, and RSCVn systems. We\nfinally present a model for the X-ray emission of NGC4365, to reproduce in\ndetail the results of the ROSAT pointed observation (PSPC spectrum and radial\nsurface brightness distribution).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 1993 13:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

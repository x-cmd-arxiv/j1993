The X-ray\npulsar 1E 2259 + 586 may be such a white dwarf. It is shown that in this case\nstarquakes may be responsible for the decrease of the mean spin-down rate which\nwas observed for 1E 2259 + 586 between 1987 and 1990. The required mass of the\nwhite dwarf which is identified with 1E 2259 + 586 is $\\sim 1.4 - 1.5 M_\\odot$,\nmaking this X-ray pulsar the most massive white dwarf known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 1993 06:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

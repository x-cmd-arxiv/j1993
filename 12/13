These galaxies represent a\nsignificant excess over the expectation of standard cosmological models for\nreasonable amounts of evolution of the locally observed galaxy population.\nHowever, the surveys which define the local galaxy population are strongly\nbiased against objects of low surface brightness$^{6-9}$. Low surface\nbrightness galaxies have properties very similar to those of the excess blue\npopulation$^{10,11}$, and recent work suggests that they are comparable in\nabundance to the more readily detected normal galaxies$^{9,12}$. I show that\nthe very deep surveys which reveal the excess population can easily detect low\nsurface brightness galaxies to large redshifts, but that local surveys will\nmiss them because they are not comparably sensitive. This suggests that the\nexcess faint galaxies {\\it are\\/} low surface brightness galaxies. No\nalteration of standard cosmology is required, but it is necessary to reconsider\nthe way in which the galaxy distribution function is specified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 1993 21:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

An electron-positron plasma near the pulsar is optically thick and in\nquasi-thermodynamic equilibrium. It is shown that the main part of radiation\nfrom the pulsar wind is nonthermal and generates in the following way. Kinetic\nenergy which is released in the process of deceleration of the neutron star\nrotation transforms mainly to the magnetic field energy. The magnetic field is\nfrozen in the outflowing plasma if the distance to the pulsar is smaller than\n$\\sim 10^{13}$ cm. This field transfers the energy from the pulsar environment\nto the region outside the $\\gamma$-ray photosphere of the electron-positron\nwind. At a distance of more than $\\sim 10^{13}$ cm the magnetohydrodynamic\napproximation for the pulsar wind is broken, and intense electromagnetic waves\nare generated. The frequency of these waves is equal to the frequency of the\npulsar rotation. Outflowing particles are accelerated in the field of intense\nelectromagnetic waves to Lorentz factors of the order of $10^6$ and generate\nnonthermal synchro-Compton radiation. The typical energy of nonthermal photons\nis $\\sim 1$ MeV. A high-energy tail of the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum may be up to\n$\\sim 10^4$ MeV. Baryonic matter is ejected occasionally from the pulsar\nmagnetosphere. The baryonic matter ejection and subsequent suppression of the\n$\\gamma$-ray emission may be responsible for the time structure of $\\gamma$-ray\nbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Dec 1993 09:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

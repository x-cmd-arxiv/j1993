Converging and Jeans\nunstable regions are allowed to form stars, which get their metallicity from\nthe gas they are formed from. Via supernovae, metal enriched gas is given back\nto the interstellar medium. The forming galaxy shows the main properties of\nspiral galaxies: A metal rich bulge, a metal poor stellar halo and a disk of\nnearly solar composition. Halo and bulge consist predominantly of old stars\n($>10.5\\,$Gyrs). The disk has a metallicity gradient of $\\dd(\\log Z) / \\dd r =\n- 0.05\\,$kpc$^{-1}$, whereas the halo shows none. The models also exhibit a\ncorrelation between the metallicity of Pop~II stars and the power of small\nscale fluctuations. The stars of the bulge form from gas which is initially\nlocated in the largest maxima of the primordial density fluctuations, whereas\nthe halo stars originate from gas accumulated in less pronounced maxima.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Dec 1993 13:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

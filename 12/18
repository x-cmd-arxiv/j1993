In previous work we studied\nthe accuracy of several analytic approximations to gravitational clustering in\nthe mildly nonlinear regime. We found that the ``truncated Zel'dovich\napproximation\" (TZA) was better than any other (except in one case the ordinary\nZeldovich approximation) over a wide range from linear to mildly nonlinear\n($\\sigma \\sim 3$) regimes. TZA sets Fourier amplitudes equal to zero for {\\it\nall} wavenumbers greater than $k_{n\\ell}$, where $k_{n\\ell}$ marks the\ntransition to the nonlinear regime. Here, we study crosscorrelation of\ngeneralized TZA with a group of $n$--body simulations for three shapes of\nwindow function: sharp $k$--truncation (as in CMS), tophat in coordinate space,\nor a Gaussian. We also study the crosscorrelation as a function of initial\nscale within each window type. We find $k$--truncation, which was so much\nbetter than other things tried in CMS, is the {it worst} of these three window\nshapes. We find that a Gaussian window $e^{-k^2/2k_G^2}$ applied to the intial\nFourier amplitudes is the best choice. It produces a greatly improved\ncrosscorrelation all cases we studied. The optimum choice of $k_G$ for the\nGaussian window is (spectrum-- dependent) 1--1.5 times $k_{n\\ell}$, with\n$k_{n\\ell}$ defined by (3). Although all three windows produce similar power\nspectra and density distribution functions after application of the Zeldovich\napproximation, phase agreement with the $n$--body simulation is better for the\nGaussian window. We ascribe Gaussian window success to its superior treatment\nof phase evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 1993 05:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

AGN, considered to be\npossible sources for the highest energy cosmic rays, may have emission\nextending well into the VHE (very high energy, E>100 GeV) domain. Because VHE\ngamma-rays are absorbed by pair production on the intergalactic background\nradiation, much of this emission is not visible. Electromagnetic cascades\ninitiated by absorbed VHE gamma-rays, however, may be observable. Since the\nvelocities of e+e- pairs produced in a cascade are likely to be isotropized by\nan ambient random magnetic field, extended ``halos'' (R>1 Mpc) of pairs will be\nformed around AGN with VHE emission. Cascade radiation from these pair halos is\nemitted isotropically and is observable below a few TeV. The halo radiation can\nbe distinguished by its characteristic variation in spectrum and intensity with\nangular distance from the central source. This variation depends weakly on the\ndetails of the central source model, e.g., the orientation and beaming/opening\nangle of an emitting jet. Limiting or determining the intensity of the pair\nhalo can thus serve as a model-independent bound on or measure of the VHE power\nof AGN. Next-generation Cherenkov telescopes may be able to image a pair halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Dec 1993 07:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}

As a guide, to fix the\nparticle-particle interaction strengths, we exploit the fact that the missing\nsymmetries of the mean field approximation are restored in the random phase\napproximation by the residual interaction. Thus, the T=1, S=0 and T=0, S=1\ncoupling strengths have been estimated by invoking the partial restoration of\nthe isospin and Wigner SU(4) symmetries, respectively. When this recipe is\nstrictly applied, the calculation is consistent with the experimental limit for\nthe $2\\nu$ lifetime of $^{48}Ca$ and it also correctly reproduces the $2\\nu$\nlifetime of $^{82}Se$. In this way, however, the two-neutrino matrix elements\nfor the remaining nuclei are either underestimated (for $^{76}Ge$ and\n$^{100}Mo$) or overestimated (for $^{128}Te$ and $^{130}Te$) approximately by a\nfactor of 3. With a comparatively small variation ($<10%$) of the spin-triplet\nparameter, near the value suggested by the SU(4) symmetry, it is possible to\nreproduce the measured $T_{1/2}^{2\\nu}$ in all the cases. The upper limit for\nthe effective neutrino mass, as obtained from the theoretical estimates of\n$0\\nu$ matrix elements, is $<m_{\\nu}>\\cong 1$ eV. The dependence of the nuclear\nmatrix elements on the size of the configuration space has been also analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Dec 1993 22:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

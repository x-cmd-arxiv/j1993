Contrary to the widespread belief that it is sufficient to keep only\nterms linear in $\\Delta t$ in the expansion if one is only interested in the\nfinal result through order $\\Delta t$, we find that all terms in the expansion\nmust be retained. We solve the combinatorical problem of summing the infinite\nseries in closed form through order $\\Delta t$. Our results straightforwardly\ngeneralize to higher orders in $\\Delta t$. We then include fermions for which\nwe use coherent states in phase space. For supersymmetric $N{=}1$ and $N{=}2$\nquantum mechanics, we find that if the super Van Vleck determinant replaces the\noriginal Van Vleck determinant the propagator factorizes into a classical part,\nthis super determinant and the extra scalar curvature term which was first\nfound by DeWitt for the purely bosonic case by imposing the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. Applying our results to anomalies in $n$-dimensional quantum field\ntheories, we note that the operator ordering in the corresponding quantum\nmechanical Hamiltonians is fixed in these cases. We present a formula for the\npath integral action, which corresponds one to one to any given covariant or\nnoncovariant $\\hat H$. We then evaluate these path integrals through two loop\norder, and reobtain the same propagators in all cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 1993 16:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

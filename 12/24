We show that upon contact with the bath (assumed ohmic in this paper)\nthe system evolves from a quantum-dominated state to a thermal-dominated state\nin a time which is the same as the decoherence time in similar models in the\ndiscussion of quantum to classical transition. This offers some insight into\nthe physical mechanisms involved in the environment-induced decoherence\nprocess. We obtain closed analytic expressions for this generalized uncertainty\nrelation under the conditions of high temperature and weak damping separately.\nWe also consider under these conditions an arbitrarily-squeezed initial state\nand show how the squeeze parameter enters in the generalized uncertainty\nrelation. Using these results we examine the transition of the system from a\nquantum pure state to a nonequilibrium quantum statistical state and to an\nequilibrium quantum statistical state. The three stages are marked by the\ndecoherence time and the relaxation time respectively. With these observations\nwe explicate the physical conditions when the two basic postulates of quantum\nstatistical mechanics become valid. We also comment on the inappropriateness in\nthe usage of the word classicality in many decoherence studies of quantum to\nclassical transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Dec 1993 16:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

We treat\nthe case where the Brownian particle is coupled linearly to a bath of time\ndependent quadratic oscillators. While the bath mimics a scalar field, the\nmotion of the Brownian particle modeled by a single oscillator could be used to\ndepict the behavior of a particle detector, a quantum field mode or the scale\nfactor of the universe. An important result of this paper is the derivation of\nthe influence functional encompassing the noise and dissipation kernels in\nterms of the Bogolubov coefficients. This method enables one to trace the\nsource of statistical processes like decoherence and dissipation to vacuum\nfluctuations and particle creation, and in turn impart a statistical mechanical\ninterpretation of quantum field processes. With this result we discuss the\nstatistical mechanical origin of quantum noise and thermal radiance from black\nholes and from uniformly- accelerated observers in Minkowski space as well as\nfrom the de Sitter universe discovered by Hawking, Unruh and Gibbons-Hawking.\nWe also derive the exact evolution operator and master equation for the reduced\ndensity matrix of the system interacting with a parametric oscillator bath in\nan initial squeezed thermal state.

Relying on the functional\nintegral formulation of Lagrangian quantum field theory a functional integral\nequation for the complete effective action is proposed which can be understood\nas a certain fixed point condition. This is motivated by a critical attitude\ntowards the distinction artificial from an experimental point of view between\nclassical and effective action. While for free field theories nothing new is\naccomplished, for interacting theories the concept differs from the established\nparadigm. The analysis of this new concept is concentrated on gauge field\ntheories treating QED as the prototype model. An approximative approach to the\nfunctional integral equation for the complete effective action of QED is\nexploited to obtain certain nonperturbative information about the quadratic\nkernels of the action. As particular application the approximative calculation\nof the QED coupling constant $\\alpha$ is explicitly studied. It is understood\nas one of the characteristics of a fixed point given as a solution of the\nfunctional integral equation proposed.

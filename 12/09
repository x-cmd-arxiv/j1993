We\nconsider primordial adiabatic perturbations and discuss power spectra that are\npower laws in volume, wavelength, and eigenvalue of the Laplace operator. The\nresulting large-angle anisotropies of the CMB are computed. The amplitude\ngenerally increases as $\\Omega$ is decreased, but decreases as $h$ is\nincreased. Interestingly enough, for all three ansatzes, anisotropies on\nangular scales larger than the curvature scale are suppressed relative to the\nanisotropies on scales smaller than the curvature scale. Models with\n$0.2<\\Omega h<0.3$ appear compatible with CMB fluctuations detected by COBE and\nTenerife and with the amplitude and spectrum of fluctuations of galaxy counts\nin galaxy surveys. COBE normalization for these models yields $\\sigma_8\\simeq\n0.5-0.7$. Models with smaller values of $\\Omega h$ when normalized to COBE\nrequire bias factors in excess of 2 to be compatible with the observed galaxy\ncounts on the $8/h$ Mpc scale.

This is found to be the case for\nthe scalar theory which is quantized by following the Dirac procedure. In spite\nof the different mechanisms of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the two\nforms of dynamics they result in the same physical content.

The symmetric vacuum\nstate for vanishingly small couplings is found to turn into an unstable\nsymmetric one when the coupling is increased and may result in a phase\ntransition of the {\\it second order} in contrast to the first order transition\nconcluded from the usual variational methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 1993 03:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

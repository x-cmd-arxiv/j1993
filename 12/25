This result has been used to examine the\nkinematic quadrupole correction $(\\Delta {\\sf T}/{\\sf T})_q=(\\Delta {\\sf\nT}/{\\sf T})_d^2/2$, which is usually applied to remove the contamination of the\nquadrupole produced by local density inhomogeneities when finding the cosmic\namplitude of the quadrupole at the surface of last scattering. We have found\nthat the quadrupole of local collapse origin cannot always be approximately\ndescribed by the kinematic quadrupole. Our numerical result shows that the\ndifference between the kinematic and local quadrupoles depends on the size and\nmatter density in the peculiar field, and the position of the observer. For a\ngiven dipole, the local quadrupole can be different from the kinematic\nquadrupole by a factor as large as 3. Therefore, the kinematic quadrupole\ncorrection remains an uncertain factor in the determination of the amplitude of\na cosmic quadrupole. Nevertheless, a preliminary analysis shows that this\nuncertainty might not dramatically change the cosmological origin of the\nCOBE-DMR's quadrupole, unless a huge peculiar gravitational field is assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 1993 17:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In all modes, the\ncorrection is small enough to be disregarded in first-generation experiments,\nbut in some of them, it may be large enough to be observed in second-generation\nexperiments. Our treatment of the $\\gamma$ modes calls attention to the fact\nthat when the quark mixing matrix is treated exactly, there are six unitarity\ntriangles, rather than just one triangle. However, only four of the angles in\nthese six triangles are independent. Examining the role played by these four\nangles, we discover that, in principle at least, measurements of nothing but\nCP-violating asymmetries in $B$ decays are sufficient to determine the entire\nquark mixing matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 1993 23:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

This value is anomalously smaller than those for clusters with\nlower symmetries, but in agreement with recent experiments. The magnetic\ninteractions between the central and surface atoms of the cluster are {\\it not}\nfully ferromagnetic, and a small amount of antiferromagnetic interactions is\nfound to be mixed in. An energy parameter is introduced to explain the\nanomalous magnetic properties, which is found to be also useful for judging\nwhether some techniques can or must be used in the\nlocal-spin-density-functional calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 1993 11:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

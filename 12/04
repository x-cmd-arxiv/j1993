We describe a series of\nprojects based upon perturbative expansions to follow the gravitational\nevolution of the one point probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the\ndensity contrast field and for the divergence of the corresponding velocity\nfield. The Edgeworth expansion greatly simplifies the problem. Indeed, the PDF\ncan be described through several low order moments, with the first non-trivial\ncontribution coming from the skewness, or third moment. Gaussian initial\nconditions imply that the skewness of the smoothed density field is\nproportional to the square of the variance. The constant of proportionality is\nthen a function of the logarithmic slope of the variance versus scale, and is\notherwise independent of scale. This constant is also practically independent\nof the density parameter $\\Omega$, and has very nearly the same value when\ndistances are estimated by redshifts. To show the latter property, we also\nbriefly discuss our Lagrangian approach to perturbation theory. Finally, the\nobserved skewness does depend, of course, on the relation between the\ndistribution of light and mass; we describe the case of local biasing. For the\ndivergence of the velocity field, the skewness of its PDF is also proportional\nto the square of its variance, but the ratio now strongly depends on the value\nof $\\Omega$. This offers a new method to determine the density parameter which\ndoes not involve comparisons\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 1993 18:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

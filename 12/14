It\nis rather clear that if a semialgebraic set $S$ can be separated from each\nconnected component of $X\\setminus(S\\cup\\frz S)$ (when $\\frz S$ stands for the\nZariski closure of $(\\ol S\\setminus{\\rm Int}(S))\\cap{\\rm Reg}(X)$), then $S$ is\nbasic. This leads to associate to $S$ a finite family of sign distributions on\n$X\\setminus\\frz S$; we prove the equivalence between basicness and two\nproperties of these distributions, which can be tested by an algorithm. There\nis a close relation between these two properties and the behaviour of fans in\nthe algebraic functions field of $X$ associated to a real prime divisor, which\ngives an easy proof, for a general surface $X$, of the well known 4-elements\nfan's criterion for basicness (Brocker, Andradas-Ruiz). Furthermore, if the\ncriterion fails, using the description of fans in dimension 2, we find an\nalgorithmic method to exhibit the failure. Finally, exploiting this thecnics of\nsign distribution we give one improvement of the 4-elements fan's criterion of\nBrocker to check if a semialgebraic set is principal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 1993 10:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The evolution depends on a constant parameter $b$, related to the\nstring energy, and falls into three classes depending on whether $b<1/4$\n(oscillatory motion), $b=1/4$ (degenerated, hyperbolic motion) or $b>1/4$\n(unbounded motion). The novel feature here is that one single world-sheet\ngenerically describes {\\it infinitely many} (different and independent)\nstrings. The world-sheet time $\\tau$ is an infinite-valued function of the\nstring physical time, each branch yields a different string. This has no\nanalogue in flat spacetime. We compute the string energy $E$ as a function of\nthe string proper size $S$, and analyze it for the expanding and oscillating\nstrings. For expanding strings $(\\dot{S}>0)$: $E\\neq 0$ even at $S=0$, $E$\ndecreases for small $S$ and increases $\\propto\\hspace*{-1mm}S$ for large $S$.\nFor an oscillating string $(0\\leq S\\leq S_{max})$, the average energy $<E>$\nover one oscillation period is expressed as a function of $S_{max}$ as a\ncomplete elliptic integral of the third kind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 1993 14:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

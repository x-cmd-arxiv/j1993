We derive simple scaling laws for\nthe sensitivity in the measurement of these couplings. For most couplings the\nsensitivity increases as $\\sqrt{L\\cdot s}$, where $L$ denotes the integrated\nluminosity and $\\sqrt s$ denotes the $e^+e^-$ center-of-mass energy. Detailed\ninvestigations based on various fits confirm these scaling laws and show that\nan accuracy of the order of the standard radiative corrections can be reached\nat the NLC for the design values of the luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 1993 09:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

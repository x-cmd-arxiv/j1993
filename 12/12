B","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cond-mat","license":null,"abstract":"  The dynamical response of triangular JJA is investigated using the RCSJ\nmodel. A flux flow regime is found to extend between a lower vortex-depinning\ncurrent and a higher critical current, in agreement with previous calculations\nfor square arrays. In the flux flow regime, the dynamical response to the bias\ncurrent is roughly Ohmic, and the time-dependent voltage can be well understood\nin terms of vortex degrees of freedom. The vortex friction coefficient $\\eta$\ndepends strongly on the McCumber-Stewart parameter $\\beta$, and at large\n$\\beta$ is approximately independent of the shunt resistance $R$. To account\nfor this, we generalize a model of Geigenm\\\"{u}ller {\\it et al} to treat energy\nloss from moving vortices to the phase analog of optical spin waves in a\ntriangular lattice. The value of $\\eta$ at all values of $\\beta$ agrees quite\nwell with this model in the low-density limit. The vortex depinning current is\nestimated as $0.042I_c$, independent of the direction of applied current, in\nagreement with static calculations by Lobb {\\it et al}. A simple argument\nsuggests that quantum effects in vortex motion may become important when the\nflux flow resistivity is of order $h/(2e)^2$ per unit frustration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Dec 1993 03:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

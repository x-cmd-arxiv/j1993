The standard code for nucleosynthesis is modified\nto allow for a massive decaying tau neutrino whose daughter products include\nneutrinos, photons, $e^\\pm$ pairs, and/or noninteracting (sterile) daughter\nproducts. Tau-neutrino decays influence primordial nucleosynthesis in three\ndistinct ways: (i) the energy density of the decaying tau neutrino and its\ndaughter products affect the expansion rate tending to increase $^4$He, D, and\n$^3$He production; (ii) electromagnetic (EM) decay products heat the EM plasma\nand dilute the baryon-to-photon ratio tending to decrease $^4$He production and\nincrease D and $^3$He production; and (iii) electron neutrinos and\nantineutrinos produced by tau-neutrino decays increase the weak rates that\ngovern the neutron-to-proton ratio, leading to decreased $^4$He production for\nshort lifetimes ($\\la 30\\sec$) and masses less than about $10\\MeV$ and\nincreased $^4$He production for long lifetimes or large masses. The precise\neffect of a decaying tau neutrino on the yields of primordial nucleosynthesis\nand the mass-lifetime limits that follow depend crucially upon decay mode. We\nidentify four generic decay modes that serve to bracket the wider range of\npossibilities:\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Dec 1993 22:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

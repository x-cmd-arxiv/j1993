The presence of noise in the data biases many statistical\nquantities in a manner dependent on both the noise properties and the unknown\nCMB temperature field.

These would imply many\npossible new phenomena such as neutrinoless $\\beta\\beta$ decay, lepton flavour\nviolating processes such as neutrino oscillations, $\\mu \\ra e \\gamma$, $\\mu \\ra\n3 e $, $\\mu \\ra e$ conversion in nuclei, as well as two-body decays with the\nemission of a superweakly interacting spin zero particle, called majoron, e.g.\n$\\mu \\ra e + J$. All of these processes may occur at levels consistent with\npresent or planned experimental sensitivities. The underlying physics may also\nbe probed at the high energies accessible at LEP, through related Z decay\nprocesses. Another possible, albeit quite indirect, manifestation of massive\nneutrinos is in Higgs physics. As an example I discuss the possibility of an\ninvisibly decaying Higgs, a quite generic feature of majoron models where the\nlepton number is spontaneously violated close to the electroweak scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 1993 11:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

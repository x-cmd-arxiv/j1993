There are many ways to\ndefine $\\vartheta(G)$, and the surprising variety of different\ncharacterizations indicates in itself that $\\vartheta(G)$ should be\ninteresting. But the most interesting property of $\\vartheta(G)$ is probably\nthe fact that it can be computed efficiently, although it lies ``sandwiched''\nbetween other classic graph numbers whose computation is NP-hard. I~have tried\nto make these notes self-contained so that they might serve as an elementary\nintroduction to the growing literature on Lov\\'asz's fascinating function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 1993 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

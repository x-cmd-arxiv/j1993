It is shown here that this model also provides a\nsoluble scattering theory, and therefore constitutes a model for a decay\nscattering system. Generalized second resolvent equations are obtained for\nquaternionic scattering theory. It is shown explicitly for this model, in\naccordance with a general theorem of Adler, that the scattering matrix is\ncomplex subalgebra valued. It is also shown that the method of Adler, using an\neffective optical potential in the complex sector to describe the effect of the\nquaternionic interactions, is equivalent to the general method of Green's\nfunctions described here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Dec 1993 14:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

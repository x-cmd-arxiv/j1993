The singularities of $C$ (if\nany) are Gorenstein, and $C$ is connected of degree $2g-2$ and arithmetic genus\n$g$. In a recent paper, Schreyer has proved that Petri's normalization of the\nhomogeneous ideal $I(C)$ of a smooth canonically-embedded curve can be also\ncarried out for singular curves, provided that the curve has a simple\n$(g-2)$-secant (a linear ${\\bf P}^{g-3}$ intersecting $C$ transversely at\nexactly $g-2$ (smooth) points). We use the Petri normalization to study the\nHilbert scheme of curves of degree $2g-2$ and arithmetic genus $g$ in ${\\bf\nP}^{g-1}$ in the low-genus cases $g = 5,6$. The main results are that the\nHilbert points of all curves for which Petri's approach applies lie on one\nirreducible component of the Hilbert scheme in these cases.

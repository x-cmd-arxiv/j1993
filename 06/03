The dependence of the\nsuppression effect on the $SU(N)$ representation of the jet parton as well as\nthe kinematic variables is expressed through a radiation formation factor.\nUnlike in QED, the finite contribution from the small $x$ regime in QCD leads\nto an approximately constant radiative energy loss per unit length,\n$dE/dz\\propto \\mu^2$, in the high energy limit that is sensitive to the\ninfrared screening scale, $\\mu$, of the medium. As a function of the\ndimensionless parameter $\\zeta=\\lambda \\mu^2/E$, we show furthermore how the\nenergy dependence of $dE/dz$ evolves from the above constant for $\\zeta\\ll 1$\nto the more familiar (Bethe-Heitler) linear dependence for $\\zeta \\gg 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 1993 21:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

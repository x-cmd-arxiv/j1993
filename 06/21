The differential cross section for the\nantiprotons is found to be very sensitive to the p-bar selfenergy adopted. A\ndetailed comparison with the available experimental data for p-nucleus and\nnucleus-nucleus reactions shows that the antiproton feels a moderately\nattractive mean-field at normal nuclear matter density which is in line with a\ndispersive potential extracted from the free annihilation cross section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jun 1993 15:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In this formalism the $1/N$ expansion can be done in a\nstraightforward way by a saddle point technique that determines the master\nfield to be identified with the vacuum expectation value of the bilocal field.\nFinally we show that the equation of motion for the fluctuations around the\nmaster field is identical with the 't Hooft meson equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 1993 15:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

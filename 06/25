Here we show that to linear order both the bending\nand breathing modes of such a slab are stable. However, nonlinear effects will\ntend to soften the restoring forces for bending modes, and when the slab\ndisplacement is comparable to its thickness this gives rise to a nonlinear\ninstability. The growth rate of the instability, above this threshold but for\nsmall bending angles, is $\\sim c_sk (k\\eta)^{1/2}$, where $\\eta$ is the slab\ndisplacement. When the bending angle is large the slab will contain a local\nvorticity comparable to $c_s/L$, where $L$ is the slab thickness. We discuss\nthe implications of this work for gravitational instabilities of slabs.\nFinally, we examine the cases of a decelerating slab bounded by a single shock\nand a stationary slab bounded on one side by thermal pressure. The latter case\nis stable, but appears to be a special case. The former case is subject to a\nnonlinear overstability driven by deceleration effects. We conclude that shock\nbounded slabs with a high density compression ratio generically produce\nsubstructure with a strong local shear, a bulk velocity dispersion like the\nsound speed in the cold layer and a characteristic scale comparable to the slab\nthickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 1993 21:07:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 1993 21:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

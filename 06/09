This is an expository version of some material in hep-th/9212115\n(where we also carry out computations for a specific finite example). We also\nexplain how to incorporate the central extensions usually explained via\n``framings'', and we show how to recover invariants of framed tangles. This\npaper is written using AMSTeX 2.1, which can be obtained via ftp from the\nAmerican Mathematical Society (instructions included). 2 encapsulated\npostscript files were submitted separately in uuencoded tar-compressed format.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 1993 19:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For an\n(infinite) sequence of critical values of $H$ an increasing number of (highest\nspin component) states lying on the first Regge trajectory becomes tachyonic.\nIn the limit of infinite $H$ all these states are tachyons (with a common\ntachyonic mass) both in the case of the bosonic string and for the\nNeveu-Schwarz sector of the fermionic string. This result generalizes to\nextended object the same instability which occurs in ordinary non-Abelian gauge\ntheories. The Ramond states have always positive square masses as is the case\nfor ordinary QED. The weak field limit of the mass spectrum is the same as for\na field theory with gyromagnetic ratio $g_S=2$ for all charged spin states.\nThis behavior suggests a phase transition of the string as it has been argued\nfor the ordinary electroweak theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 1993 12:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

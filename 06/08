We make the coordinate transformation of this propagator from the\nc.m. frame of the two-particle subsystem to the three-particle c.m. frame. We\nalso point out that some numerical applications of the Ahmadzadeh and Tjon\npropagator to the three-nucleon problem use unnecessary nonrelativistic\napproximations which do not simplify the computational task, but violate\nconstraints of relativistic unitarity and/or covariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 1993 11:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

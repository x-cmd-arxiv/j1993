The pion exchange transition potentials\nbetween isobar channels are included in this partial wave to obtain the correct\nequilibrium between one- and two-pion decay channels. Other improvements to\nearlier models have been made, in the specification of isobar channels and the\ninclusion of decay width effects in more channels. A comparison is made with\nall the $pp$ data for $T_L \\le 800$~MeV, producing a very good fit over the\nwhole energy range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 1993 16:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

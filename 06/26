We then discuss how this relates to the primitive cohomology of\n$X$. Also, if $T$ is the torus contained in $X$, then the intersection of $X$\nand $T$ is an affine hypersurface in $T$, and we show how recent results of the\nsecond author can be stated using various ideals in the ring $S$.\n  To prove our results, we must give a careful description (in terms of $S$) of\n$d$-forms and $(d-1)$-forms on the toric variety $P$. For completeness, we also\nprovide a proof of the Bott-Steenbrink-Danilov vanishing theorem for simplicial\ntoric varieties.\n  Other topics considered in the paper include quasi-smooth hypersurfaces and\n$V$-submanifolds, the structure of the complement of $U$ when $P$ is\nrepresented as the quotient of an open subset $U$ of affine space, a\ngeneralization of the Euler exact sequence on projective space, and the\nrelation between graded pieces of $R/J(f)$ and the moduli of ample\nhypersurfaces in $P$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 1993 16:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

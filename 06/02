The\ndiscussion includes the covariant gauge, in which the gauge condition and\nGauss's law are not primary constraints on operator-valued quantities; it also\nincludes the Coulomb gauge, and the spatial axial gauge, in which the\nconstraints are imposed on operator-valued fields by applying the\nDirac-Bergmann procedure. We show how to transform the covariant, Coulomb and\nspatial axial gauges to what we call\n  ``common form,'' in which all particle excitation modes have identical\nproperties. We also show that, once that common form has been reached, QED in\ndifferent gauges has a common time-evolution operator that defines\ntime-translation for states that represent systems of electrons and photons.\n  By combining gauge transformations with changes of representation from\nstandard to common form, the entire apparatus of a gauge theory can be\ntransformed from one gauge to another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 1993 21:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

This is accomplished by defining the Lagrangian\nand Hamiltonian as the real part of a graded total trace over the underlying\nHilbert space, permitting a consistent definition of the first variational\nderivative with respect to a general operator--valued coordinate. The\nHamiltonian form of the equations is expressed in terms of a generalized\nbracket operation, which is conjectured to obey a Jacobi identity. The\nformalism permits the natural implementation of gauge invariance under\noperator--valued gauge transformations. When an operator Hamiltonian exists as\nwell as a total trace Hamiltonian, as is generally the case in complex quantum\nmechanics, one can make an operator gauge transformation from the Heisenberg to\nthe Schr\\\"odinger picture. When applied to complex quantum mechanical systems\nwith one bosonic or fermionic degree of freedom, the formalism gives the usual\noperator equations of motion, with the canonical commutation relations emerging\nas constraints associated with the operator gauge invariance. More generally,\nour methods permit the formulation of quaternionic quantum field theories with\noperator--valued gauge invariance, in which we conjecture that the operator\nconstraints act as a generalization of the usual canonical commutators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 1993 20:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

The extensive data set overcomes the\ndifficulties encountered by traditional fitting approaches when using rich and\ncomplex analytic forms, allowing to construct potentials with a degree of\naccuracy comparable to that obtained by ab initio methods.

We then illustrate some nonperturbative approaches, which\naim at a dynamical, QCD-based calculation of the universal form factors of the\neffective theory. The main focus is on results obtained using QCD sum rules.\nFinally, we perform an essentially model-independent analysis of semileptonic\n$B$ meson decays in the context of the heavy quark effective theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jun 1993 22:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

The morphogens are in turn are effected by the\npassage of an organism. The evolution of the morphogens, and the corresponding\nflow of the organisms constitutes the collective behavior of the group. Such\nmodels have various types of phase transitions and self-organizing properties\ncontrolled both by the level of the noise, and other parameters.\n  The model is then applied to the specific case of ants moving on a lattice.\nThe local behavior of the ants is inspired by the actual behavior observed in\nthe laboratory, and analytic results for the collective behavior are compared\nto the corresponding laboratory results.\n  It is hoped that the present model might serve as a paradigmatic example of a\ncomplex cooperative system in nature. In particular swarm models can be used to\nexplore the relation of nonequilibrium phase transitions to at least three\nimportant issues encountered in artificial life. Firstly, that of emergence as\ncomplex adaptive behavior. Secondly, as an exploration of continuous phase\ntransitions in biological systems. Lastly, to derive behavioral criteria for\nthe evolution of collective behavior in social organisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 1993 03:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-25"}

A V band surface brightness profile (SBP) was constructed from CCD\nimages, and, after it was determined that the cluster is not post\ncore-collapse, fit with single- and multi-mass King-Michie (KM) models. The\ntotal cluster luminosity is 1.70 $\\pm 0.1 \\times 10^5$ L$_V$\\sol. A total of\n285 stellar spectra were obtained of 215 stars for radial velocity\ndeterminations. Four stars showed strong evidence for radial velocity\nvariations and are probably members of binary systems. The true cluster binary\nfraction was determined from simulations to be 0.15 for circular orbits or 0.27\nfor orbits with a distribution function $f(e) = e$ ($e$ is eccentricity). This\nrelatively high binary detection frequency may indicate that NGC 362 is\noverabundant in binaries compared to other clusters. The 208 remaining stars\nshowed no sign of rotation. The best agreement with both the kinematic data and\nthe SBP were for shallow mass functions $x = 0.0 - 0.5$ and intermediate\namounts of anisotropy in the velocity dispersion tensor. The cluster mass is M\n= $2.5 - 3.5 \\times 10^5$ M\\sol\\ for a global mass-to-light ratio of M/L$_V$ =\n1.5 - 2.0 M\\sol/L$_V$\\sol. This low value for $x$ is in disagreement with the\ncorrelation between $x$ and the height above the Galactic disk seen for a\nsample of other clusters. The results are also different from the sharp turn-up\nin the low mass end of mass functions derived from some deep luminosity\nfunctions of three other globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 1993 21:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

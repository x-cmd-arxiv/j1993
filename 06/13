By re-analysing the published IUE/optical observations, we show that\nmost starbursts present a normal Ly-alpha emission, consistent with case B\nrecombination theory, provided extinction laws appropriate to their\nmetallicities are used. This implies that extinction is more important than\nmultiple resonant scattering effects. The anomalous emission and absorption\nlines present in a few remaining galaxies are simply explained if they are\nobserved in the post-burst phase, between about 10$^7$ and 10$^8$ yrs after the\nstart of the burst. We use updated stellar population synthesis models to show\nthat anomalous ratios are produced by the aging of stellar populations, since\nthe underlying stellar Ly-alpha line is important in the cooler massive stars.\nThe inferred low-duty cycle of massive star formation accounts naturally for\nthe failure to detect large numbers of Ly-alpha--emitting galaxies in deep\nsurveys and at high redshift. Some testable predictions of the proposed\nscenario are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 1993 07:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

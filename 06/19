We develop a self-consistent disk picture\nthat accounts naturally for these transitions and their corresponding spectral\nvariations. We argue that the bump is due to the self-Comptonization of\nbremsstrahlung photons emitted predominantly near the plane of the corona\nitself. Our results suggest that a decrease by a factor of approx 2 in the\nviscosity parameter alpha is responsible for quenching this bump and driving\nthe system to the gamma_2 state, whereas a transition from gamma_2 to gamma_3\nappears to be induced by an increase of about 25 % in the accretion rate Mdot.\nIn view of the fact that most of the transitions observed in this source seem\nto be of the gamma_2 to gamma_3 variety, we conclude that much of the long term\ngamma-ray spectral variability in Cygnus X-1 is due to these small fluctuations\nin Mdot. The unusual appearance of the gamma_1 state apparently reflects a\nchange in the dissipative processes within the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 1993 05:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

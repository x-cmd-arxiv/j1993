Biased models have systematically higher VPFs than\nunbiased models, but for a given biasing scheme the VPF is relatively\ninsensitive to the value of the bias factor $b$. Thus, while the VPF can\ndistinguish unbiased models from some biased models, it is probably not a\nuseful way to constrain the bias factor; uncertainties in the appropriate\nchoice of biasing prescription overwhelm the mild dependence on $b$. We compare\nthe predictions of our models to the most extensive VPF observations published\nto date.

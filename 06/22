If the\nstellar system is stable, it is commonly assumed that such a mode will be\nstrongly damped and therefore of little practical consequence other than\nredistributing momentum and energy deposited by the perturber. This paper\ndemonstrates that this assumption is false; weakly damped modes exist and may\npersist long enough to have observable consequences. To do this, a method for\ninvestigating the dispersion relation for spherical stellar systems and for\nlocating weakly damped modes in particular is developed and applied to King\nmodels of varying concentration. This leads to the following remarkable result:\nKing models exhibit {\\it very} weakly damped $m=1$ modes over a wide range of\nconcentration ($0.67\\le c\\le1.5$ have been examined). The predicted damping\ntime is tens to hundreds of crossing times. This mode causes the peak density\nto shift from and slowly revolve about the initial center. The existence of the\nmode is supported by n-body simulation. Higher order modes and possible\nastronomical consequences are discussed. Weakly damped modes, for example, may\nprovide a natural explanation for observed discrepancies between density and\nkinematic centers in galaxies, the location of velocity cusps due to massive\nblack holes, and $m=1$ disturbances of disks embedded in massive halos.\nGravitational shocking may excite the $m=1$ mode in globular clusters, which\ncould modify their subsequent evolution and displace the positions of exotic\nremnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 1993 04:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The time evolution is given by a Vlasov-equation\nfor the quark phase-space distribution and a Klein-Gordon equation for the\nmean-field describing the nucleon as a soliton bag. The Vlasov equation is\nsolved numerically using an extended testparticle method. We test the\nconfinement mechanism and mean-field effects in 1+1 dimensional simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 1993 09:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Our simulations are designed to quantify\nadaptation and to explore co-adaptation for a simple calculable model of a\ncomplex adaptive system. We first consider the ability of a single agent,\nexposed to a chaotic environment, to model, control, and predict the future\nstates of that environment. We then introduce a second agent which, in\nattempting to model and control both the chaotic environment and the first\nagent, modifies the extent to which that agent can identify patterns and\nexercise control. We find that (i) optimal adaptive predictors have an optimal\nmemory and an optimal complexity, which are small for a rapidly changing map\ndynamics and (ii) that the predictive power can be increased by imposing chaos\nor random noise onto the map dynamics. The competition between the two\npredictive agents can lead either to chaos, or to metastable emergent behavior,\nbest described as a leader-follower relationship. Our results suggest a\ncorrelation between optimal adaptation, optimal complexity, and emergent\nbehavior, and provide preliminary support for the concept of optimal\nco-adaptation near the edge of chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 1993 21:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

In the infinitely long cloud in\nhydrostatic configuration, small perturbations grow by the gravitational\ninstability. The most unstable mode indicated by a linear perturbation theory\ngrows selectively even from a white noise. The growth rate agrees with that\ncalculated by the linear theory. First, the density-enhanced region has an\nelongated shape, i.e., prolate spheroidal shape. As the collapse proceeds, the\nhigh-density fragment begins to contract mainly along the symmetry axis.\nFinally, a spherical core is formed in the non-magnetized cloud. In contrast,\nan oblate spheroidal dense disk is formed in a cloud in which the magnetic\npressure is nearly equal to the thermal one. The radial size of the disk\nbecomes proportional to the initial characteristic density scale-height in the\nr-direction. As the collapse proceeds, a slowly contracting dense part is\nformed (approximately < 10% in mass) inside of the fast contracting disk. And\nthis is separated from other part of the disk whose inflow velocity is\naccelerated as reaching the center of the core. From arguments on the Jeans\nmass and the magnetic critical mass, it is concluded that the fragments formed\nin a cylindrical elongated cloud can not be supported against the self- gravity\nand it will eventually collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 1993 02:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

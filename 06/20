The new approach is based on an extended\ncollision operator that uses the gradients of the fluid velocity. The numerical\nperformance of the lattice Boltzmann method is tested on several problems with\nexact solutions and is also compared to an explicit finite difference\nprojection method. The discretization error of the lattice Boltzmann method\ndecreases quadratically with finer resolution both in space and in time. The\nroundoff error of the lattice Boltzmann method creates problems unless double\nprecision arithmetic is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 1993 19:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

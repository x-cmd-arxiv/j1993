The condensates appearing in the OPE side of the\ncorrelators become T-dependent through the interaction with thermal pions. We\npresent an explicit demonstration that the $O(T^2)$-dependence of the\ncondensates is completely compensated by the change of the pole residue and the\n$\\pi + B \\rightarrow B'$ scattering effect in the spectral functions. Therefore\nthe baryon masses are constant to this order, although\n$\\langle\\bar{u}u\\rangle_T\\simeq\\langle\\bar{u}u\\rangle_0(1-T^2/8f_\\pi^2)$, which\nis consistent with the chiral symmetry constraint by Leutwyler and Smilga.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 1993 23:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

This includes bound states as well as the region above threshold, to\nthe same degree of accuracy; in both cases radiative and nonperturbative\ncorrections are included. The contribution of this region to the vacuum\npolarization (``threshold effects'') is calculated and compared with a\nperturbative calculation; the importance of the threshold effects is found\nsubstantially smaller than claimed by some authors. Open fermion-antifermion\nproduction is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 1993 18:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

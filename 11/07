We use one-dimensional operator-split finite-difference schemes\nfor hydrodynamics with a von Neumann artificial viscosity. An internal-energy\nscheme converges to demonstrably wrong solutions. We associate this failure\nwith the presence of discontinuities in the limiting solution. Our extension of\nthe Lax-Wendroff theorem guarantees that certain conservative, operator-split\nschemes converge to the correct continuum solution. For such a total-energy\nscheme applied to the formation of a single shock, convergence of a Cauchy\nerror approaches the expected rate slowly. We relate this slowness to the\neffect of varying diffusion, due to varying linear artificial-viscous length,\non small-amplitude waves. In an appendix we discuss the scaling of\nshock-transition regions with viscous lengths, and exhibit several difficulties\nfor attempts to make extrapolations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 1993 21:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The\nframework is well--suited for quantization of diffeomorphism invariant theories\nof connections.\n  The general setting is provided by the abelian C* algebra of functions on the\nquotient space of connections generated by Wilson loops (i.e., by the traces of\nholonomies of connections around closed loops). The representation theory of\nthis algebra leads to an interesting and powerful ``duality'' between\ngauge--equivalence classes of connections and certain equivalence classes of\nclosed loops. In particular, regular measures on (a suitable completion of)\nconnections/gauges are in 1--1 correspondence with certain functions of loops\nand diffeomorphism invariant measures correspond to (generalized) knot and link\ninvariants. By carrying out a non--linear extension of the theory of\ncylindrical measures on topological vector spaces, a faithful, diffeomorphism\ninvariant measure is introduced. This measure can be used to define the Hilbert\nspace of quantum states in theories of connections. The Wilson--loop\nfunctionals then serve as the configuration operators in the quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 1993 00:45:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 1993 14:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

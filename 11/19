The meson fields are\nrestricted to the chiral circle and to hedgehog configurations. The only\nparameter of the model is the constituent quark mass $M$ which simultaneously\ncontrols the regularization. We evaluate meson and quark fields\nself-consistently in dependence on the constituent quark mass. It is shown that\nthe self-consistent fields do practically not depend on the constituent quark\nmass. This allows us to define a properly parameterized reference field which\nfor physically relevant constituent masses can be used as a good approximation\nto the exactly calculated one. The reference field is chosen to have correct\nbehaviour for small and large radii. To test the agreement between\nself-consistent and reference fields we calculate several observables like\nnucleon energy, mean square radius, axial-vector constant and delta-nucleon\nmass splitting in dependence on the constituent quark mass. The agreement is\nfound to be very well. Figures available on request.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 1993 13:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

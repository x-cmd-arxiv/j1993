These two-particle equations are shown to be related\nby a transformation of variables. Hence we show how to perform and relate\nidentical dynamical calculation using these two equations. Similarly, starting\nfrom the Bethe-Salpeter-Faddeev equation for the three-particle system and\nintegrating over the time component of momentum, we derive several three\ndimensional three-particle scattering equations satisfying constraints of\nrelativistic unitarity and covariance. We relate two of these three-particle\nequations by a transformation of variables as in the two-particle case. The\nthree-particle equations we derive are very practical and suitable for\nperforming relativistic scattering calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 1993 13:06:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 1993 16:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

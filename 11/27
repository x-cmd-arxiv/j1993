The dramatic increase in the transmission of the quenched samples, and\nthe relaxation towards the transmission observed in slow cooled samples\nprovides direct evidence for the existence of a metastable insulating phase.\nSlow cooling results in a phase transition between two electrically conducting\nphases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 1993 19:17:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 1994 23:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

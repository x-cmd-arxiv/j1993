In particular, the effective scalar\ncoupling to the Maxwell field, $e^{-\\alpha \\phi} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}$, gives\nrise to a new string black hole with $\\alpha = \\sqrt{3}$, in contrast to the\npure dilaton black hole solution which has $\\alpha=1$. This means that\nelectric/magnetic duality in $D=4$ may be seen as a consequence of\nstring/fivebrane duality in $D=10$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 1993 21:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

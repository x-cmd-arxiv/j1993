In the weakly nonlinear regime\nwe find that the dominant nonlinear contribution for realistic cosmological\nspectra is made by the coupling of long-wave modes and is well estimated by\nsecond order perturbation theory. For a linear spectrum like that of the cold\ndark matter model, second order effects cause a significant enhancement of the\nhigh $k$ part of the spectrum and a slight suppression at low $k$ near the peak\nof the spectrum. Our perturbative results agree well in the quasilinear regime\nwith the nonlinear spectrum from high-resolution N-body simulations.\n  We find that due to the long-wave mode coupling, characteristic nonlinear\nmasses grow less slowly in time (i.e., are larger at higher redshifts) than\nwould be estimated using the linear power spectrum.

Away from the\nsingularity, all the conserved currents vanish. The solution comes in 8\nvarieties, corresponding to any choice of positive or negative charge, spin or\nmass (though it is presumed that the negative mass solutions are not physical).\nThe charge is quantised, and determined up to sign by the coupling constant in\nthe theory. The main element in the construction is simply the requirement that\nthe solution be rotationally symmetric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 1993 15:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

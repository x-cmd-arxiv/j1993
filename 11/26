Also, they generally had\nassociated masers, and thus were most likely young compact HII regions\ncontaining star forming regions.

On the other hand in the spontaneously broken\nmodels with fermions the CS-equation contains a beta-function of a physical\nmass. As a consequence the beta-functions depend on the normalization point\nalso in the asymptotic region and a mass independent limit does not exist\nanymore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 1993 11:17:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 1993 11:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We analyze two CHDM simulations with $b =1.5$\n(COBE normalization). We also compare them with CDM simulations with $b=1.5$\nand $b=1$. We evaluate high-order correlation functions and the\nvoid-probability-function (VPF). Correlation functions are obtained both from\ncounts in cells and counts of neighbors. The analysis is made for DM particles\nand for galaxies, identified as massive halos in the evolved density field. We\nalso check the effects of dynamical evolution and redshift space distortions.\nWe find that clustering of DM particles exhibits deviations from the\nhierarchical scaling, which decrease somewhat in redshift space. Galaxies\nfollow hierarchical scaling far more closely, with coefficients S_3=2.5 and\nS_4=7.5, in general agreement with observational results, just marginally\naffected by redshift distortions and on the choices for the initial spectra.\nThe hierarchical scaling of galaxy clustering is confirmed by the VPF analysis\nand in all the cases considered a good agreement with observational results is\nobtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Nov 1993 11:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

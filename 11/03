The particular case which we study in this paper is pair\ncreation in an external electric field and the back reaction is the counter\nfield produced by the pair \\underline {as} it is made. The construction leads\nto a complex electric field obtained from non diagonal matrix elements of the\ncurrent operator, the interpretation of which is clear in terms of weak\nmeasurement. The analogous construction applied to black hole physics (thereby\nleading to a complex metric) is relegated to a future paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 1993 13:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The dependence on the spectral parameters corresponds to the\nstatic limit of the modified tetrahedron equations and weights are\nparameterized in terms of elliptic functions.

In this case posing the bifurcation\nproblem with either PBC or NBC on a finite domain can lead to a symmetric\nbifurcation problem for which the manifest symmetries of the domain do not\ncompletely characterize the constraints due to symmetry on the bifurcation\nequations. Additional constraints due to the Euclidean symmetry of the\nequations can have a crucial influence on the structure of the bifurcation\nequations. An example is the bifurcation of standing waves on the surface of\nfluid layer. The Euclidean symmetry of an infinite fluid layer constrains the\nbifurcation of surface waves in a finite container with square cross section\nbecause the waves satisfying PBC or NBC can be shown to lie in certain\nfinite-dimensional fixed point subspaces of the infinite-dimensional problem.\nThese constraints are studied by analyzing the finite-dimensional vector fields\nobtained on these subspaces by restricting the bifurcation equations for the\ninfinite layer. Particular emphasis is given to determining which bifurcations\nmight reveal observable effects of the rotational symmetry of the infinite\nlayer. It turns out that a necessary condition for this possibility to arise is\nthat the subspace for PBC must carry a reducible representation of the\nnormalizer subgroup acting on the subspace. This condition can be met in\ndifferent ways in both codimension-one and codimension-two bifurcations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 1993 17:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

As a possibility to relax this constraint, it has been\nproposed that early reionization can damp CMB fluctuations on small scales due\nto photon diffusion in the ionized plasma. As an example, I investigate the\nrecently proposed scenario with cold dark matter (CDM) and texture seeds.\nThere, an analysis of CMB anisotropies shows that early reionization is a\ncrucial ingredient for this scenario. Without damping, the small scale\nanisotropies would dominate and exceed observed limits. In this paper I present\nanalytical and numerical results for the amount of damping due to early\nreionization for CMB perturbations induced by a collapsing texture.\nFurthermore, the spectral distortion of the CMB due to Compton scattering of\nthe hotter plasma electrons is calculated. Next I discuss the physical\nprocesses which lead to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for\nthe degree of ionization, the electron temperature and the evolution of the\nionizing radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 1993 14:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Implications with regard to Hawking's chronology protection\nconjecture are discussed. Indeed, any attempt to transform a single isolated\nwormhole into a time machine results in large vacuum polarization effects\nsufficient to disrupt the internal structure of the wormhole before the onset\nof Planck scale physics, and before the onset of time travel.

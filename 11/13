Analytic expressions are found in three\ndifferent regimes: near the threshold, at energies much larger than the\nelectron rest mass M, and at ultrahigh energies, much larger than $M/\\delta$,\nwith $\\delta$ the string mass per unit length in Planck units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 1993 19:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We explicitly calculate its gauge\ndependence, which, due to the massiveness of the top quark, turns out to be\nnumerically very sizable. We show how to use the S-matrix pinch technique in\norder to define gauge independent form factors. The real and imaginary parts of\nthe gauge independent MDM form factor are calculated and their dependence on\nthe top quark and Higgs boson masses is discussed.

We use the thermal quark masses, $m_i^2(T)\\simeq m_i^2 + (2g^2/9)T^2$,\nin all the rates. At small mass ($m_i(T)<2T$), the production is largely\ndominated by the thermal gluon decay channel.

One\nmethod for deriving such equations is the classification-of-diagrams technique\nof Taylor. However, as we shall explain in this paper, there are certain points\nof Taylor's method which require clarification. Firstly, it is not clear\nwhether Taylor's original method is equivalent to the simpler\nclassification-of-diagrams scheme used by Thomas, Rinat, Afnan and Blankleider\n(TRAB). Secondly, when the Taylor method is applied to certain problems in a\ntime-dependent perturbation theory it leads to the over-counting of some\ndiagrams. This paper first restates Taylor's method, in the process uncovering\nreasons why certain diagrams might be double-counted in the Taylor method. It\nthen explores how far Taylor's method is equivalent to the simpler TRAB method.\nFinally, it examines precisely why the double-counting occurs in Taylor's\nmethod, and derives corrections which compensate for this double-counting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 1993 05:47:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 1994 02:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

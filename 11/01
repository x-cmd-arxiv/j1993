The luminosity-weighted radius of the broad\nline region (BLR), as derived from the cross-correlation function, is of the\norder of 10 light days. This result is very uncertain because the features in\nthe light curves are very shallow, but it is unlikely that the radius of the\nBLR is more than 1 light month. The profile variations of H-Alpha confirm that\nthe prevailing motions are not radial.

Working in radial quantization leads to a\nquasi-chiral factorization of the space of fields. The conserved charges which\ngenerate the affine Lie algebra split into two independent affine algebras on\nthis factorized space, each with level 1 in the anti-periodic sector, and level\n$0$ in the periodic sector. The space of fields in the anti-periodic sector can\nbe organized using level-$1$ highest weight representations, if one supplements\nthe $\\slh$ algebra with the usual local integrals of motion. Introducing a\nparticle-field duality leads to a new way of computing form-factors in radial\nquantization. Using the integrals of motion, a momentum space bosonization\ninvolving vertex operators is formulated. Form-factors are computed as vacuum\nexpectation values in momentum space.

Let $F$ be a smooth complex Finsler metric on a\ncomplex manifold $M$, and assume that the indicatrices of $F$ are strongly\npseudoconvex -- we shall say that $F$ itself is strongly pseudoconvex.\n  The vertical bundle $\\cal V$ is the kernel of the differential of the\ncanonical projection of the holomorphic tangent bundle of $M$. Using $F$, it is\npossible to endow $\\cal V$ with a hermitian metric; let $D$ be the Chern\nconnection associated to this metric. It turns out that there is a canonical\nway to build starting from $D$ a horizontal bundle $\\cal H$, as well as a\nbundle isomorphism $\\Theta\\colon{\\cal V}\\to\\cal H$. Using $\\Theta$ we may\ntransfer both the metric and the connection on $\\cal H$; furthermore, there is\na canonical isometric embedding $\\chi$ of the holomorphic tangent bundle of $M$\ninto $\\cal H$.\n  Our idea is that the Finsler geometry of $M$ can be studied applying standard\nhermitian techniques to $\\cal H$ using $\\chi$ to transfer back and forth\nproblems and solutions. To support this claim, in this paper we discuss Bianchi\nidentities, K\\\"ahler conditions, the first and second variation formulas,\ngeodesics and holomorphic curvature. Furthermore, we provide a sound geometric\ninterpretation to our previous work on the existence of complex geodesic\ncurves. Finally, we prove that in complex K\\\"ahler Finsler manifolds with\nconstant nonpositive holomorphic curvature (and satisfying an additional\nsymmetry property on the curvature) the complex geodesic curves define a nice\nfibration of the manifold, completely analogous to the one described by Lempert\nin strongly convex domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 1993 17:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

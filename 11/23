The path integral method is used to quantize the system and\nthe spectrum is obtained with asymptotically linear Regge trajectories. Two\ndynamical regimes distinguished by the string energy--momentum distribution are\nfound: at large orbital excitations ($l\\gg 1$) the system behaves as a string\nand yields the Regge slope of $\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma}$, while at small $l$ one\nobtains a potential-like regime for relativistic or nonrelativistic system .\nThe problem of relative time is clarified. It is shown that in the valence\nquark approximation one can reduce the initial four-dimensional dynamics to the\nthree-dimensional one. The limiting case of a pure string (without quark\nkinetic terms) is studied and the spectrum of the straight-line string is\nobtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 1993 14:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Nov 1993 16:53:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Dec 1993 21:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 1994 18:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}

The discussion of the tree-level\nscattering amplitudes of this theory presented in hepth/9310131 is expanded to\ninclude amplitudes containing two twisted-sector states. These amplitudes are\nshown to satisfy spurious state decoupling. The restriction to only two\nexternal twisted-sector states is due to the absence of an appropriate\ndimension-one vertex describing the emission of a single twisted-sector state.\nThis is analogous to the ``old covariant'' formalism of ordinary superstring\namplitudes in which an appropriate dimension-one vertex for the emission of a\nRamond-sector state is lacking. Examples of tree scattering amplitudes are\ncalculated in a c=5 model of the spin-4/3 chiral algebra realized in terms of\nfree bosons on the string world-sheet. The target space of this model is\nthree-dimensional flat Minkowski space-time and the twisted-sector physical\nstates are fermions in space-time.

Specific attention is paid to\neffective interactions of massive vector fields, which can be embedded within\ngauge noninvariant theories or within spontaneously broken gauge theories.\nThese different types of models are related to each other by the Stuckelberg\nformalism, which is reformulated within the Hamiltonian formalism. Effective\nLagrangians with higher derivatives of the fields are also considered. The HLE\ntheorem is even valid in this case because each effective higher-order\nLagrangian can be reduced to a first-order one by applying the equations of\nmotion to the effective interaction term. This thesis is essentially a\ncombination of previous publications of the author.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 1993 13:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

X-ray selection of the cluster sample picks out objects on the\nbasis of the depth of their potential well depth, and is insensitive to both\nprojection effects and galaxy biases. The galaxy dataset, with selection\ncontrolled using automated photometry, automated mask design, spectral\nselection modeling, and accurate velocities, will be the best available at any\nredshift for our tests. Measuring mass-to-light ratios (M/L) at large radii\nrequires a statistical removal of field galaxies projected into the redshift\nspace of the cluster. This can be done relatively accurately for moderate\nredshift clusters, using the large number of foreground and background\ngalaxies. The CNOC sample also provides a sensitive test of the density\nfluctuation spectrum on cluster scales. The 30 or so redshifts available in\neach of three clusters gives an average velocity dispersion of about 1000 \\kms\nwhich indicates that the $\\sigma_8$ normalization parameter is in the range of\n$0.6\\lta \\sigma_8\\lta 0.9$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 1993 18:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

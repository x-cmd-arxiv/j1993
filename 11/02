We develop\na hamiltonian formalism that describes the time evolution as seen by an\nasymptotic observer, and write a scattering equation that relates the\nin-falling and out-going modes at low energies. At higher incoming energy flux,\nhowever, the classical matter-mirror dynamics becomes unstable and the mirror\nruns off to infinity. This instability provides a useful paradigm for black\nhole formation and introduces an analogous information paradox. Finally, we\npropose a new possible mechanism for restoring the stability in the\nsuper-critical situation, while preserving quantum coherence.

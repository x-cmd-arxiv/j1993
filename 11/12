This\nnew hierarchy contains both the higher KdV hierarchy and multi--field\nrepresentation of KP hierarchy as sub--systems and naturally appears in\nmulti--matrix models. The N+2M-1 coordinates or fields of this hierarchy\nsatisfy two algebras of compatible Poisson brackets which are {\\it local} and\n{\\it polynomial}. Each Poisson structure generate an extended W_{1+\\infty} and\nW_\\infty algebra, respectively. We call W(N, M) the generating algebra of the\nextended W_\\infty algebra. This algebra, which corresponds with the second\nPoisson structure, shares many features of the usual $W_N$ algebra. We show\nthat there exist M distinct reductions of the (N, M)--th KdV hierarchy, which\nare obtained by imposing suitable second class constraints. The most drastic\nreduction corresponds to the (N+M)--th KdV hierarchy. Correspondingly the W(N,\nM) algebra is reduced to the W_{N+M} algebra. We study in detail the\ndispersionless limit of this hierarchy and the relevant reductions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Nov 1993 16:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The linearized version of the KPI\nequation is first considered by solving the initial value problem for different\nclasses of initial data. Properties of the solutions in different cases are\nanalyzed in details. The obtained results are used as a guideline for studying\nthe properties of the solution $u(t,x,y)$ of the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili I\n(KPI) equation with given initial data $u(0,x,y)$ belonging to the Schwartz\nspace. The spectral theory associated to KPI is studied in the space of the\nFourier transform of the solutions. The variables $p=\\{p_1,p_2\\}$ of the\nFourier space are shown to be the most convenient spectral variables to use for\nspectral data. Spectral data are shown to decay rapidly at large $p$ but to be\ndiscontinuous at $p=0$. Direct and inverse problems are solved with special\nattention to the behaviour of all the quantities involved in the neighborhood\nof $t=0$ and $p=0$. It is shown in particular that the solution $u(t,x,y)$ has\na time derivative discontinuous at $t=0$ and that at any $t\\not=0$ it does not\nbelong to the Schwartz space no matter how small in norm and rapidly decaying\nat large distances the initial data are chosen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 1993 08:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

For this purpose a special technique is\ndeveloped, which reduces the formalism of complex tunnelling geometries to the\nreal ones, and also the method of collective variables is applied, separating\nthe macroscopic collective degrees of freedom from the microscopic modes. The\nquantum distribution of Lorentzian universes, defined on the space of such\ncollective variables, incorporates the probabilty conservation and represents\nthe partition function of quasi-DeSitter gravitational instantons weighted by\ntheir Euclidean effective action. They represent closed compact manifolds\nobtained by the procedure of doubling the Euclidean spacetime which nucleates\nthe Lorentzian universes. The over-Planckian behaviour of their distribution is\ndetermined by the anomalous scaling of the theory on such instantons, which\nserves as a criterion for the high-energy normalizability of the no-boudary\nwavefunction and the validity of the semiclassical expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Nov 1993 04:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

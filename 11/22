In the FFA it is\nassumed that the velocity field remains unchanged from its value obtained from\nthe linear theory whereas in FPA the same approximation is made for the\ngravitational potential. In this paper we compare these and the older\nZel'dovich approximation by calculating the evolution of the density in\nperturbation theory. In particular we compute the skewness, including the\nsmoothing effects, and the kurtosis for the FFA, FPA and Zel'dovich\napproximation and compare their relative accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 1993 13:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

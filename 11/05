The isotopically substituted species\n(isotopomers), H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and H$^{13}$CN, were observed in order to\ndetermine, whenever possible, the optical thickness of the main species. The\nmost abundant isotopomers were found in almost all the sources (detection rate\n70-90\\%). Those sources which exhibited the strongest signals were also\nsearched for the $^{13}$C isotopomers. H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ was found in one dark\ncloud and around three Herbig Ae/Be stars, while H$^{13}$CN around only one\nstar. The column densities for each species and the physical conditions of the\nobjects were derived whenever the observational data allowed it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 1993 10:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

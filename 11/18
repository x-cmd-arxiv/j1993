In `bottom--up' formation scenarios (such as\nthe ubiquitous cold dark matter model), galaxies form before rich clusters;\nhence, cluster formation is intimately linked to galaxy formation which, in\nturn, is tied to star formation. I will examine two issues which appear\nrelatively insensitive to galaxy/star formation --- the baryon fraction in\nclusters and the connection between X--ray morphology and $\\Omega_o$ --- and\nend with a topic that is intimately linked to it --- dynamical biases in the\ncluster galaxy population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Nov 1993 22:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

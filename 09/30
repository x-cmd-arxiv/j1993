In Part I\n(hep-th/9309076), the notions of $P(z)$- and $Q(z)$-tensor product of two\nmodules for a vertex operator algebra were introduced and under a certain\nhypothesis, two constructions of a $Q(z)$-tensor product were given, using\ncertain results stated without proof. In Part II, the proofs of those results\nare supplied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 1993 14:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 1995 16:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

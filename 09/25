This lessens\nsignificantly the CMB anisotropies at a small angular scale. Reionization also\nincreases the Jeans mass to $M_{\\rm luminous}\\approx 10^9M_\\odot$ for $z\\lsim\n10$, which leads to a cut-off of the luminosity function of normal galaxies on\na faint side. A strong uv flux is expected at $z\\approx 2-5$, and the null\nresult of the Gunn-Peterson test is naturally explained. Early star formation\nalso results in production of heavy elements, and the observational metal\nabundance sets a strong constraint on the photon energy injection into the\nintergalactic space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Sep 1993 06:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

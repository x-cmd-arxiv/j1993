The coefficients are defined as the overlap matrix\nelement between product states and a coupled state with good SU3 quantum\nnumbers. A technique for resolution of the outer degeneracy problem, based upon\nactions of the infinitesimal generators of SU3 is developed, which\nautomatically produces vector coupling coefficients with symmetries under\nexchange of state labels which parallel the familiar symmetries of the SU2\ncase. An algorithm for efficient computation of these coefficients is outlined,\nfor which an ANSI C code is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 1993 11:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

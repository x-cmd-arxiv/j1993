The goal of this theory is to\nconstruct a ``vertex tensor category'' structure on the category of modules for\na suitable vertex operator algebra. The notion of vertex tensor category is\nessentially a ``complex analogue'' of the notion of symmetric tensor category,\nand in fact a vertex tensor category produces a braided tensor category in a\nnatural way. The theory applies in particular to many familiar ``rational''\nvertex operator algebras, including those associated with WZNW models, minimal\nmodels and the moonshine module. In this paper (Part I), we introduce the\nnotions of $P(z)$- and $Q(z)$-tensor product, where $P(z)$ and $Q(z)$ are two\nspecial elements of the moduli space of spheres with punctures and local\ncoordinates, and we present the fundamental properties and constructions of\n$Q(z)$-tensor products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Sep 1993 01:58:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 1995 16:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

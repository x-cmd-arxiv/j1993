Proposed mechanisms include hydrodynamic and MHD\nlocal instabilities and long range effects mediated by wave transport. The most\npromising models incorporate the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar instability, caused by\nan instability of the magnetic field embedded in a differentially rotating\ndisk. This has the important feature that the induced turbulent motions\nnecessarily transport angular momentum outward. By contrast, convective modes\nmay transport angular momentum in either direction. Combining the magnetic\nfield instability with an $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo driven by internal waves leads\nto a model in which the dimensionless viscosity scales as $(H/r)^{4/3}$.\nHowever, this model has a phenomenology which is quite different from the\n$\\alpha$ disk model. For example, an active disk implies some source of\nexcitation for the internal waves. In binary systems with a mass ratio of order\nunity the most likely exciting mechanism is a parametric instability due to\ntidal forces. This implies that in systems where the accretion stream is\nintermittent, like MV Lyrae or TT Ari, epochs when the mass flow is absent or\nvery small will be epochs in which the disk shrinks and becomes relatively\ninactive and dark. This model also implies that forced vertical mixing is\nimportant, even in convectively stable disks. I discuss various observational\ntests of this model and the focus of current theoretical work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 1993 16:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

First of all, there exist\nseveral proposals how to solve cosmological problems by adiabatic expansion of\nthe Universe, without any use of inflation. We explain why these models do not\nsolve the flatness/entropy problem. On the other hand there exist some claims\nthat inflation also does not solve the flatness problem. We show that these\nclaims are correct to a certain extent for old and new inflation, but are\nincorrect for simplest versions of chaotic inflation. The second issue to be\nconsidered is the classification of inflationary models. At present many\ninflationary models are compared to each other in order to understand which of\nthem better describes observational data. Unfortunately, this often leads to\nterminological misunderstandings and even to misleading conclusions. We discuss\nthree coexisting types of classification of inflationary models and explain\ntheir relation to each other. We also briefly describe the hybrid inflation\nmodel, which combines several interesting features of different inflationary\nmodels. Finally we show that it is possible to describe inflationary universe\nby a stationary (i.e. time-independent) probability distribution to find a\ndomain of a given size containing matter with given properties. This represents\na strong deviation of inflationary cosmology from the standard Big Bang\nparadigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 1993 18:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We describe the\nStandard Model predictions for the various types of CP asymmetries and discuss\nthe theoretical cleanliness of these predictions. We point out the ingredients\nin the analysis that are most sensitive to new physics and deduce the type of\nnew physics that is likely to modify the Standard Model predictions. Several\nexplicit examples are discussed in detail. Finally, we explain how, if\ndeviations from the Standard Model predictions are measured, we will be able to\nlearn detailed features of the new physics involved.

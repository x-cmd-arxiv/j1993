It is a multigroup (frequency-dependent) code and includes all\nimportant $O(v/c)$ effects. It is applied to the model W7 of Nomoto,\nThielemann, \\& Yokoi (1984) for supernovae of type Ia. Radioactive energy\ndeposition is incorporated through use of tables based upon Monte Carlo\nresults. Effects of line opacity (both static or line blanketing and expansion\nor line blocking) are neglected, although these may prove to be important. At\nmaximum light, models based upon different treatments of the opacity lead to\nvalues for $M_{B,max}$ in the range of -19.0 to -19.4. This range falls between\nthe values for observed supernova claimed by Leibundgut \\& Tammann (1990) and\nby Pierce, Ressler, \\& Shure (1992).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Sep 1993 18:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

It\nis now possible to go beyond the power law description to measure the point at\nwhich the correlation function becomes zero. Four independent measurements\nindicate that the zero point, $r_0$, should be in the range (40-60)$h^{-1}$Mpc.\nThe large value of $r_0$ at which the zero-point occurs rules out conventional\nCDM models independently of the assumed amplitude. Models with $\\Omega < 0.25$\nshould be rejected because they predict too large $r_0$. If the age of the\nUniverse is assumed to be larger than 15 Gyr, models with either $\\Omega<0.5$\nor $h> 0.55$ are rejected. We present the results of numerical simulations of\nclusters in an $\\Omega=1$ cosmological model with a mixture of cold plus hot\ndark matter (CHDM).

Turning to\nexclusive decays, we compare the predictions from quark models, QCD sum rules,\neffective Lagrangians and lattice QCD. Quark models have anticipated on heavy\nquark symmetry. Their difficutly to account for the $q^2$ dependence might be\npartly cured by relativistic corrections. QCD sum rules and lattice seem to\ndisagree on the $q^2$ dependence of axial form factors. We discuss the\nextrapolation from $D$ to $B$. Present uncertainties do not allow to predict\nreliably the $B\\ra\\pi,\\rho l \\nu$ matrix elements.

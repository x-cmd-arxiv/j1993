The radial velocity fields are derived using tensor Gaussian\nsmoothing of radius 1200 km/s. They are compared at grid points near which the\nsampling by both types of galaxies is proper. This requirement defines a volume\nof ~(50 Mpc/h)^3, containing ~10 independent subvolumes, mostly limited by the\navailable ellipticals. The two fields are compared using a correlation\nstatistic, whose distribution is determined via Monte-Carlo simulations. We\nfind that the data is consistent with the hypothesis, at the 10% level. We\ndemonstrate that the failure to reject the correlation is not just a result of\nthe errors being big, by using the same method to rule out complete\nindependence between the fields at the 99.8% level. The zero points of the two\ndistance indicators are matched by maximizing the correlation between the two\nvelocity fields. There is a marginal hint that the ellipticals tend to stream\nslower than the spirals by ~8%. The correlation reinforced here is consistent\nwith the common working hypotheses that (a) the derived large-scale velocity\nfield is real, (b) it has a gravitational origin, and (c) the large-scale\nvelocities of spirals and ellipticals are hardly biased relative to each other.\nOn the other hand, it does not rule out any alternative to gravity where\nobjects of all types obtain similar large-scale velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 1993 17:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The level density of strings is of the right order of magnitude to\nreproduce the Bekenstein entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 1993 20:22:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 1993 14:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Whereas in a theory with only Virasoro\nsymmetry the three point functions of descendants fields are uniquely\ndetermined by the three point function of the corresponding primary fields this\nis not the case for a theory with $W_3$ algebra symmetry. The generic 3-point\nfunctions of W-descendant fields have a countable degree of arbitrariness. We\nfind, however, that if one of the fields belongs to a representation with null\nstates that this has implications for the 3-point functions. In particular if\none of the representations is doubly-degenerate then the 3-point function is\ndetermined up to an overall constant. We extend our analysis to 4-point\nfunctions and find that if two of the W-primary fields are doubly degenerate\nthen the intermediate channels are limited to a finite set and that the\ncorresponding chiral blocks are determined up to an overall constant. This\ncorresponds to the existence of a linear differential equation for the chiral\nblocks with two completely degenerate fields as has been found in the work of\nBajnok~et~al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Sep 1993 09:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The photometric data clearly show the double-peaked nucleus,\nin excellent agreement with a recent HST image by Lauer et al. 1993. We built\ndeconvolved surface brightness models, using the multi-Gaussian expansion\nmethod. We then perform a detailed morphological analysis of the three central\nphotometric components (bulge, nucleus and bright secondary peak) and derive\nvarious spatial luminosity models (oblate and triaxial). Stellar velocity and\nvelocity dispersion fields were derived from the TIGER data: the former\ndisplays an extremely rapid rotation around the true center of the galaxy,\nwhile the latter exhibits a peaked structure offset in the opposite direction\nof the brightest light peak. Neglecting these offsets,both extended versions of\nthe virial theorem and detailed hydrodynamical models confirm the classical\nstrong central mass concentration, perhaps a supermassive black hole of about\n7.10**7 Msun, as well as a large excess of circular motions. These offsets,\nhowever, suggest that the nucleus presently undergoes a strong stellar\noscillation, with non-stationary, non-axisymmetric dynamics. This too reopens\nthe case for a strong central mass concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 1993 16:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Loosely\nspeaking, we need all renormalizations to have bounded combinatorial rotation\nnumber (assumption C1) and sufficiently high combinatorial type (assumption\nC2).\n  For real quadratic polynomials of bounded combinatorial type the complex a\npriori bounds were obtained by Sullivan.

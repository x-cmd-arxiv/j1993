Three approaches are presented in a\npedagogical manner, based on (1) the Eulerian fluid equations, (2) the\nLagrangian description of trajectories, and (3) the Lagrangian fluid equations.\nLinear and nonlinear limits are discussed for each case. Shear and tides are\nshown to play a key role in nonlinear gravitational instability.\n  The Lagrangian fluid approach is used to show that several widely held\nbeliefs about gravitational instability are false. The following collapse\ntheorem is proven: for a given initial density fluctuation and growth rate, the\nspherical tophat perturbation collapses more slowly than any other\nconfiguration. We also show that density maxima are not the first points to\ncollapse and that underdense regions may collapse if their initial shear is\nsufficiently high. The Lagrangian fluid approach leads to an almost closed set\nof local evolution equations for individual mass elements. The magnetic part of\nthe Weyl tensor, which may be present even in the nonrelativistic (Newtonian)\nlimit, may prevent a purely local description. However, neglecting the magnetic\npart of the Weyl tensor, we obtain predictions for high-redshift collapse that\nare in good agreement with a high-resolution cold dark matter N-body\nsimulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 1993 21:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We establish\na set of sufficient conditions for the occurence of spin and charge separation.\nSpecifically, we discuss this issue in the context of the Heisenberg model for\nspin-1/2 on a square lattice with nearest ($J_1$) and next-nearest ($J_2$)\nneighbor antiferromagnetic couplings. Our formulation makes explicit the\nexistence of a local SU(2) gauge symmetry once the spin-1/2 operators are\nreplaced by bound states of spinons. The mean-field theory for the spinons is\nsolved numerically as a function of the ratio $J_2/J_1$ for the so-called s-RVB\nAnsatz. A second order phase transition exists into a novel flux state for\n$J_2/J_1>(J_2/J_1)_{{\\rm cr}}$. We identify the range $0<J_2/J_1<(J_2/J_1)_{\\rm\ncr}$ as the s-RVB phase. It is characterized by the existence of a finite gap\nto the elementary excitations (spinons) and the breakdown of all the continuous\ngauge symmetries. An effective continuum theory for the spinons and the gauge\ndegrees of freedom is constructed just below the onset of the flux phase. We\nargue that this effective theory is consistent with the deconfinement of the\nspinons carrying the fundamental charge of the gauge group. We contrast this\nresult with the study of the one dimensional quantum antiferromagnet within the\nsame approach. We show that in the one dimensional model, the spinons of the\ngauge picture are always confined and thus cannot be identified with the\ngapless spin-1/2 excitations of the quantum antiferromagnet Heisenberg model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 1993 16:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

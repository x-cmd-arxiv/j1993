We also show that the\nextrapolation of our cross section to ultra-high energies, of relevance to the\ncosmic ray physics, gives significant contribution to the ``conventional''\nvalue, but cannot account for the anomalous muon content observed in the cosmic\nray air-showers associated with astrophysical point sources$^4$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Sep 1993 16:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

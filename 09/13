We obtain\nan acceptable fit to most of the spectrum, including the infrared bands. The\nfit requires a distance of $\\ge 2 \\kpc$, which implies that BD+30$^\\circ$3639\nhas evolved from a massive progenitor of several solar masses. Two surprising\nresults are (1) a very low dust-to-gas ratio, (2) an absence of the smallest\nPAH molecules. Extrapolating back in time, we calculate the previous infrared\nevolution of BD+30$^\\circ$3639.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 1993 09:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Fits to the COBE 53A+B x 90A+B angular correlation function are\nobtained using simple analytic forms for the effective potential in chaotic\ninflation models. Not surprisingly, these fits are optimized for a nearly\nscale-free fluctuation power spectrum. However, from the chi^2 distribution for\nthe fits we can set upper limits of n le 1.2 and n le 7 at the 1 sigma and 2\nsigma confidence levels, respectively, for a V(phi) = lambda phi^n effective\npotential. Similarly, new limits on parameters for polynomial effective\npotentials can be determined at the 1 sigma and 2 sigma confidence levels. The\nmost stringent constraint, however, is on the overall magnitude of the\neffective potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 1993 10:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

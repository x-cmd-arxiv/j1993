The method is based on a\nkinematic Zel'dovich relation between the velocity and density fields in\nredshift space. This relation is expressed in a differential equation slightly\nmodified from the usual Poisson equation, and which depends non-trivially on\n$\\beta \\equiv \\Omega^{0.6}/b$. The linear equation can be readily solved by\nstandard techniques of separation of variables by means of spherical harmonics.\nOne can also include a term describing the ``rocket effect\" discussed by Kaiser\n(1987). From this redshift space information alone, one can generate a\nprediction of the peculiar velocity field for each harmonic ($l,m$) as a\nfunction of distance. We note that for the quadrupole and higher order moments,\nthe equation is a boundary value problem with solutions dependent on both the\ninterior and exterior mass distribution. However, for a shell at distance $r$,\nthe dipole, as well as the monopole, of the velocity field in the Local Group\nframe is fully determined by the interior mass distribution. This implies that\nthe shear of the measured velocity field, when fit to a dipole distortion,\nshould be aligned and consistent with the gravity field inferred from the well\ndetermined local galaxy distribution. As a preliminary application we compute\nthe velocity dipole of distant shells as predicted from the 1.2Jy IRAS survey\ncompared to the measured velocity dipole on shells, as inferred from a recent\nPOTENT analysis. The coherence between the two fields is good, yielding a best\nestimate of $\\beta= 0.6 \\pm 0.2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 1993 01:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

With the aid\nof Monte Carlo calculations we compare the observed nearest neighbor\ndistributions with those expected from an isotropic source population weighted\nby the published BATSE exposure map. The significance of the results are\nassessed via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, as well as by a comparison to\nMonte Carlo simulations. The K-S results are in basic agreement with those of\nQuashnock and Lamb. However, as Narayan and Piran (1993) point out, and the\nMonte Carlo calculations confirm, the K-S test overestimates the significance\nof the observed distributions. We compare the sensitivity of these results to\nboth the definitions of the assumed burst sub-classes and the burst positional\nerrors. Of the two, the positional errors are more significant and indicate\nthat the results of Quashnock and Lamb may be due to systematic errors, rather\nthan any intrinsic correlation among the burst positions. Monte Carlo\nsimulations also show that with the current systematic errors, the nearest\nneighbor statistic is not very sensitive to moderate repetition rates. Until\nthe BATSE statistical and systematic errors are fully understood, the burst\nnearest neighbor correlations cannot be claimed to be significant evidence for\nburst repetitions.

It is found that the extended $s$ and the\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$-channels are {\\em not} degenerate near half filling. Extended\n$s$-pairing with a low $T_c$ occurs only for a band containing less then 0.4\nelectrons or holes per unit cell, whereas in a large region around half-filling\n$d$-wave pairing is the only stable superconducting solution. At half filling\nsuperconductivity is suppressed due to the formation of the anti-ferromagnetic\nMott-Hubbard insulating state. By extending the analysis to the unconstrained\n$t-t'-J$ model, it is proven that, if a Fermi surface is assumed similar to the\none that is known to exist in cuprous oxide superconductors, the highest\nsuperconducting $T_c$ is reached for about $0.7$ electron per site, whereas the\nanti-ferromagnetic solution still occurs for $1$ electron per site.

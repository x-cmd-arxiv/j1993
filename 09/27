This deep exposure enabled a search for candidate\npre-main sequence (PMS) objects in this cloud to a limit 20 times more\nsensitive than that typical of the fields examined with the Einstein searches.\nDespite assertions that the PMS population in Taurus-Auriga is nearly\ncompletely known, this x-ray survey revealed 8 new PMS objects in a region 50'\nin diameter, as compared to a previously known stellar population of 12\nobjects, including deeply embedded IRAS sources. Spectroscopic and photometric\nobservations enable us to place these objects in the HR Diagram. The newly\ndiscovered objects are predominantly stars of spectral type M0 and later, and a\nlarge fraction (6/8) appear to be surrounded by circumstellar accretion disks\nas judged by their infrared excess and H alpha emission. We combined the data\nfor these x-ray discovered objects with extant and new data for the previously\nidentified PMS stars in this region to examine the history of star formation\nand the frequency distribution of stellar masses in this cloud. If the ``post\nROSAT'' population is either complete or representative, we conclude (1) that\nstar formation in L1495 East took place 1 x 10^6 yrs ago and that the spread in\nages is small; (2) the frequency distribution of masses,\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Sep 1993 21:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The problem of deriving gauge invariant\ninteracting equations can be addressed using the proper time formalism. This\nformalism is discussed, both for point particles and strings. The covariant\nKlein Gordon equation arises in a geometric way from the boundary terms. This\nformalism is similar to the background independent open string formalism\nintroduced by Witten.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 1993 15:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

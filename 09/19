The cosmological density parameter Omega can then be\nconstrained in three ways: (a) by comparing the density fields of mass and\ngalaxies, (b) by using the velocity field in voids, and (c) by investigating\nquasilinear deviations from Gaussian fluctuations.

It is shown that, for backgrounds generated from compact WZW and\ncoset models, such duality symmetries are exact to all orders in string\nperturbation theory. A global treatment of duality symmetries is given, by\nassociating them to the known symmetries of affine current algebras\n(affine-Weyl group and external automorphisms). It is argued that self-duality\nsymmetries of WZW and coset models generate the duality symmetries of their\nmoduli space. Some remarks are presented, concerning the survival of such\nsymmetries in the non-compact case. The implications of duality symmetries for\nstring dynamics in non-trivial/singular spacetimes are discussed.

This is\nthe ordered phase of the Ising model and the high temperature, deconfined phase\nof the gauge theory. The flux picture will be used in this phase. Near the\ntransition, the density is low enough so that flux variables remain useful.\nThere is a finite density of finite flux clusters on both sides of the phase\ntransition. In the deconfined phase, there is also an infinite, percolating\nnetwork of flux with a density that vanishes as $T \\rightarrow T_{c}^{+}$. On\nboth sides of the critical point, the nonanalyticity in the total flux density\nis characterized by the exponent $(1-\\alpha)$.

Such shifted gaussian orbits appear in the\ngenerator-coordinate model of two-cluster systems and, as ingredients of\ngenerating functions, in the resonating group model as well. A Pauli projection\nis to be understood as a projection onto the subspace not occupied by the core\nnucleons. This is an exact procedure to take into account the Pauli principle\nin the limit in which the core is infinitely heavy, thus the procedure to be\npresented is very useful in the microscopic description of large-core plus\nsmall-cluster systems, such as involved in $\\alpha$-decay problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 1993 22:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

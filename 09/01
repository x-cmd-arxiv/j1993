Gas dissipates energy radiatively\nand sinks to the center of the dark halo forming the luminous part of a galaxy.\nThe resulting central density enhancement can alter the halo's orbital\ndistribution. We simulate dissipative infall inside of an initially triaxial\nN-body dark halo by slowly growing a potential in the center of the particle\ndistribution. The dark halo transforms from a prolate-triaxial halo ($T \\sim\n0.8$) to an oblate-triaxial halo ($T \\sim 0.5$) while approximately preserving\nthe flattening ($c/a \\sim 0.5$). The main implication is that dark halos are\nrounder and more oblate than previous predictions of purely collisionless\nsimulations with the new constraint that $b/a \\gapp 0.7$. At the same time, the\ndistribution of intrinsic flattenings of dark halos ($\\langle c/a \\rangle =\n0.5$, $\\langle (c/a)^2 \\rangle ^{1/2} = 0.15$) is preserved during the period\nof baryonic infall. The oval distortions of disk galaxies should therefore be\nslightly less than original predictions from collisionless dark halos. The\npredicted distribution of shapes for dark halos from cosmological N-body\nsimulations is in better agreement with distribution of ellipticities of\nelliptical galaxies if we assume all halos and galaxies become oblate-triaxial\nin response to baryonic dissipation. The observed distribution of kinematic\nmisalignment angles is also consistent with this shape distribution if\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 1993 21:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

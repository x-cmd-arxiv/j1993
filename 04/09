An action of the model is the\nsum of the standard string action and a term describing an interaction of a\nmetric with a linear (affine) connection. The Lagrangian of this interaction is\nan arbitrary analytic function $f(R)$ of the scalar curvature. This is a\nclassically integrable model. The space of classical solutions of the theory\nconsists from sectors with constant curvature. In each sector the equations of\nmotion reduce to the standard string equations and to an additional constant\ncurvature equation for the linear connection. A bifurcation in the space of all\nLagrangians takes place. Quantization of the model is briefly discussed. In a\nquasiclassical approximation one gets the standard string model with a\nfluctuating cosmological constant.

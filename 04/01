Packard examined the frequency of\nevolved CA rules as a function of Langton's lambda parameter (Langton, 1990),\nand interpreted the results of his experiment as giving evidence for the\nfollowing two hypotheses: (1) CA rules able to perform complex computations are\nmost likely to be found near ``critical'' lambda values, which have been\nclaimed to correlate with a phase transition between ordered and chaotic\nbehavioral regimes for CA; (2) When CA rules are evolved to perform a complex\ncomputation, evolution will tend to select rules with lambda values close to\nthe critical values. Our experiment produced very different results, and we\nsuggest that the interpretation of the original results is not correct. We also\nreview and discuss issues related to lambda, dynamical-behavior classes, and\ncomputation in CA. The main constructive results of our study are identifying\nthe emergence and competition of computational strategies and analyzing the\ncentral role of symmetries in an evolutionary system. In particular, we\ndemonstrate how symmetry breaking can impede the evolution toward higher\ncomputational capability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 1993 21:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

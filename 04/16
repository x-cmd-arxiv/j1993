In this paper we compute the statistical properties of the\nshort ($\\le 2$~s) and long ($>2$~s) bursts using a method of analysis that\nmakes no assumption regarding the location of the bursts, whether in the Galaxy\nor at a cosmological distance. We find the 64 ms channel on BATSE to be more\nsensitive to short bursts and the 1024 ms channel is more sensitive to long\nbursts. We show that all the currently available data are consistent with the\nsimple hypothesis that both short and long bursts have the same spatial\ndistribution and that within each population the sources are standard candles.\nThe rate of short bursts is $\\sim 0.4$ of the rate of long bursts. Although the\ndurations of short and long gamma-ray bursts span several orders of magnitude\nand the total energy of a typical short burst is smaller than that of a typical\nlong burst by a factor of $\\sim 20$, surprisingly the peak luminosities of the\ntwo kinds of bursts are equal to within a factor of $\\sim 2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 1993 15:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We found supersymmetric (extreme) solutions which in\ngeneral interpolate between isolated superstring vacua with non-equal value of\nthe matter potential; they correspond to the static, planar domain walls with\n{\\it flat} metric in the string (sigma model) frame.\n  We point out similarities between the space-time of dilatonic walls and that\nof charged dilatonic black holes. We also comment on non-extreme solutions\ncorresponding to expanding bubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 1993 02:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

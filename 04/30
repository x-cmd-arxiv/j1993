The well-established distribution of projected axial\nratios of clusters with richness class $R\\ge 0$ is recovered very\nsatisfactorily by means of a simple model with no free parameters. The main\nperturbers are relatively rich ($R\\ge 1$) single clusters and/or groups of\nclusters (superclusters) of a wider richness class ($R\\ge 0$) located within a\ndistance of about 65 $h^{-1}$ Mpc from the perturbed cluster. This makes the\nproposed scheme be also consistent with all reported alignment effects\ninvolving clusters. We find that this tidal interaction is typically in the\nsaturate regime (\\ie the maximum elongation allowed for systems in equilibrium\nis reached), which explains the very similar intrinsic axial ratio shown by all\nclusters. Tides would therefore play an important role in the dynamics of large\nscale structures, in particular, they should be taken into account when\nestimating the virial mass of clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 1993 06:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

We rely on the ADE\nclassification of these manifolds and on their construction as HyperK\\\"ahler\nquotients, due to Kronheimer.\n  So doing we are able to define the family of (4,4) theories corresponding to\na ${\\cal M}_{\\zeta}$ family of ALE manifolds as the deformation of a solvable\norbifold ${\\bf C}^2 \\, / \\, \\Gamma$ conformal field-theory, $\\Gamma$ being a\nKleinian group. We discuss the relation among the algebraic structure\nunderlying the topological and metric properties of self-dual 4-manifolds and\nthe algebraic properties of non-rational (4,4)-theories admitting an infinite\nspectrum of primary fields. In particular, we identify the Hirzebruch signature\n$\\tau$ with the dimension of the local polynomial ring ${\\cal R}=\\o {{\\bf\nC}[x,y,z]}{\\partial W}$ associated with the ADE singularity, with the number of\nnon-trivial conjugacy classes in the corresponding Kleinian group and with the\nnumber of short representations of the (4,4)-theory minus four.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 1993 15:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

First, in some cases, the neutron-proton\n($np$) version of an NN potential was compared to the proton-proton ($pp$)\ndata, which is improper and yields (large) $\\chi^2$ that are essentially\nmeaningless. Second, for a proper test of the quantitative nature of a NN\npotential, it is insufficient to compare to $pp$ data only, since this leaves\nthe T=0 potential untested. Thus, it can happen that the $pp$ version of a\npotential predicts the $pp$ data accurately, while the $np$ version of that\nsame potential is poor in $np$ (where also the T=0 potential is involved). An\nexample for this is the Nijmegen potential, which predicts the $pp$ data well\nwith a $\\chi^2$/datum of 2.0, but yields a $\\chi^2$/datum of 6.5 in $np$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 1993 05:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

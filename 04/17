The distance to the faintest\nbursts in the halo is either $\\sim130$ Kpc or $\\sim270$ Kpc.\n  Although a signature of a nearby-extragalactic distance scale in the data is\nvery suggestive, we argue that a comparison with specific models is necessary\nbefore regarding our findings as a conclusive evidence. If the increasing data\nsupports our results then gamma-ray bursts may be the first detected\nmanifestations of nearby intergalactic objects, either primordial or which have\nescaped predominantely from our satellite galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 1993 23:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This significant fact can be exploited to\nprovide a new, powerful, approximation scheme for studying the formation of\nnonlinear structures in the universe. This scheme, discussed in this paper,\nevolves the initial perturbation using a Newtonian gravitational potential\nfrozen in time. We carry out this procedure for different intial spectra and\ncompare the results with the Zeldovich approximation and the frozen flow\napproximation (proposed by Mattarrese et al. recently). Our results are in far\nbetter agreement with the N-body simulations than the Zeldovich approximation.\nIt also provides a dynamical explanation for the fact that pancakes remain thin\nduring the evolution. While there is some superficial similarity between the\nfrozen flow results and ours, they differ considerably in the velocity\ninformation. Actual shell crossing does occur in our approximation; also there\nis motion of particles along the pancakes leading to further clumping. These\nfeatures are quite different from those in frozen flow model.

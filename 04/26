We present rigorous analytical estimates for the statistical\nuncertainty in the power and we are able to derive a rigorous optimal weighting\nscheme under the reasonable (and largely empirically verified) assumption that\nthe long wavelength Fourier components are Gaussian distributed. We apply the\nformalism to the updated 1-in-6 QDOT IRAS redshift survey, and compare our\nresults to data from other probes: APM angular correlations; the CfA and the\nBerkeley 1.2Jy IRAS redshift surveys. Our results bear out and further quantify\nthe impression from e.g.\\ counts-in-cells analysis that there is extra power on\nlarge scales as compared to the standard CDM model with $\\Omega h\\simeq 0.5$.\nWe apply likelihood analysis using the CDM spectrum with $\\Omega h$ as a free\nparameter as a phenomenological family of models; we find the best fitting\nparameters in redshift space and transform the results to real space. Finally,\nwe calculate the distribution of the estimated long wavelength power. This\nagrees remarkably well with the exponential distribution expected for Gaussian\nfluctuations, even out to powers of ten times the mean. Our results thus reveal\nno trace of periodicity or other non-Gaussian behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 1993 15:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

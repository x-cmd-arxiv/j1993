In contrast to the classical Torelli theorem the Prym\ndata does not always determine uniquely the pair $(\\tilde{C},\\sigma )$ up to\nisomorphism. In this paper we introduce an extension of the Prym data as\nfollows. We consider all symmetric theta divisors $\\Theta $ of $J(\\tilde{C})$\nwhich have even multiplicity at every point of order 2 of $P$. It turns out\nthat they form three $P_2$ orbits. The restrictions on $P$ of the divisors of\none of the orbits form the orbit $\\{ 2\\Xi \\} $, where $\\Xi $ are the symmetric\ntheta divisors of $P$. The other restrictions form two $P_2$-orbits\n$O_1,O_2\\subset \\mid 2\\Xi \\mid $. The extended Prym data consists of $(P,\\Xi )$\ntogether with $O_1,O_2$. We prove that it determines uniquely the pair\n$(\\tilde{C} ,\\sigma )$ up to isomorphism provided $g(\\tilde{C})\\geq 3$. The\nproof is analogous to Andreotti's proof of Torelli's theorem and uses the Gauss\nmap for the divisors of $O_1,O_2$. The result is an analog in genus $>1$ of a\nclassical theorem for elliptic curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 1993 16:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The energy-momentum method assumes that one is in the context of a\nmechanical system with a given symmetry group. Our result assumes that the\ndissipation chosen does not destroy the conservation law associated with the\ngiven symmetry group---thus, we consider internal dissipation. This also\nincludes the special case of systems with no symmetry and ordinary equilibria.\nThe theorem is proved by combining the techniques of Chetaev, who proved\ninstability theorems using a special Chetaev-Lyapunov function, with those of\nHahn, which enable one to strengthen the Chetaev results from Lyapunov\ninstability to spectral instability. The main achievement is to strengthen\nChetaev's methods to the context of the block diagonalization version of the\nenergy momentum method given by Lewis, Marsden, Posbergh, and Simo. However, we\nalso give the eigenvalue movement formulae of Krein, MacKay and others both in\ngeneral and adapted to the context of the normal form of the linearized\nequations given by the block diagonal form, as provided by the energy-momentum\nmethod. A number of specific examples, such as the rigid body with internal\nrotors, are provided to illustrate the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 1993 20:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

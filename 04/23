The expectation that this\nmoduli space is well-behaved in these ``extra structure'' directions leads us\nto formulate a simple and compelling conjecture about the action of the\nautomorphism group on the K\\\"ahler cone.

We explore the implications which this construction has\nconcerning the properties of the moduli space of complex structures on a\n``mirror partner'' of the original Calabi-Yau manifold.

However, due to the\nrecursive definition of wavelets, their controllable localization in both space\nand wave number (time and frequency) domains, and the vanishing moments\nproperty, wavelet based algorithms exhibit new and important properties.\n  For example, the multiresolution structure of the wavelet expansions brings\nabout an efficient organization of transformations on a given scale and of\ninteractions between different neighbouring scales. Moreover, wide classes of\noperators which naively would require a full (dense) matrix for their numerical\ndescription, have sparse representations in wavelet bases. For these operators\nsparse representations lead to fast numerical algorithms, and thus address a\ncritical numerical issue.\n  We note that wavelet based algorithms provide a systematic generalization of\nthe Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and its descendents.\n  These topics will be the subject of the lecture. Starting from the notion of\nmultiresolution analysis, we will consider the so-called non-standard form\n(which achieves decoupling among the scales) and the associated fast numerical\nalgorithms.

Many smaller, rapid flares are\nsuperimposed on a general doubling of the intensity. During the five-day period\nwhen sampling was roughly continuous, the rapid flaring had an apparent\nquasi-periodic nature, with peaks repeating every ~0.7 days. The short- and\nlong-wavelength ultraviolet light curves are well correlated with each other,\nand with the optical light curve deduced from the Fine Error Sensor (FES) on\nIUE. The formal lag is zero but the cross-correlation if asymmetric in the\nsense that the shorter wavelength emission leads the longer. The ultraviolet\nspectral shape varies a small but significant amount. The correlation between\nspectral shape and intensity is complicated; an increase in intensity is\nassociated with spectral hardening, but lags behind the spectral change by ~1\nday. The sign of the correlation is consistent with the nonthermal acceleration\nprocesses expected in relativistic plasmas, so that the present results are\nconsistent with relativistic jet models, which can also account for\nquasi-periodic flaring. In contrast, currently proposed accretion disk models\nare stronly ruled out by the simultaneous optical and ultraviolet variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 1993 18:42:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 1993 21:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Its phase diagram exhibits an SL(2,Z) duality\nsymmetry and has an infinite number of critical circles in the\ndissipation/magnetic field plane. In addition, multi-critical points on a\nparticular critical circle correspond to non-trivial solutions of open string\ntheory. The duality symmetry is expected to provide relations between\ncorrelation functions at different multi-critical points. Many of these\ncorrelators are contact terms. However we expect them to have physical\nsignificance because under duality they transform into functions that are\nnon-zero for large separations of the operators. Motivated by the search for\nexact, regulator independent solutions for these contact terms, in this paper\nwe derive many properties and symmetries of the coordinate correlation\nfunctions at the special multi-critical points. In particular, we prove that\nthe correlation functions are homogeneous, piecewise-linear functions of the\nmomenta, and we prove a weaker version of the anticipated duality\ntransformation. Consequently, the possible forms of the correlation functions\nare limited to lie in a finite dimensional linear space. We treat the potential\nperturbatively and these results are valid to all orders in perturbation\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 1993 21:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Such observations\nallow measurements of the rotational velocity out to 1.8 a_e (effective radii)\nfrom the galaxy center, where the surface brightness is \\mu_B ~ 24 mag\narcsec**-2. The rotation curve quickly reaches an asymptotic value, v_f ~ 260\nkm/s, with only marginal indication of systematic decline within the range of\nour observations. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion has also been measured;\nit decreases steeply from a rather high central value and flattens out\n(<\\sigma> ~ 100 km/s) within our observing range (a ~< 1.3 a_e). Models built\non these data and simple dynamical arguments show that the M/L of NGC 3115 must\nthus be increasing from M/L = 6 (in solar units) in the inner regions (~ 1 a_e)\nto at least M/L >= 10 in the outermost regions (~ 2 a_e).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 1993 14:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For 105 mass choices we have calculated Poincar\\'e maps for\n$10\\times 18$ starting points. Our results show that the Poincar\\'e section\n(and hence the phase space) divides into three well defined regions with orbits\nof different characteristics: 1) There is a region of fast scattering, with a\nminimum of pairwise collisions and smooth dependence on initial values. 2) In\nthe chaotic scattering region the interaction times are longer, and both the\ninteraction time and the final state depend sensitively on the starting point\non the Poincar\\'e section.

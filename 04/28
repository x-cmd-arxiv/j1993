In this paper, I show that\nsuch features cause distinctive stellar kinematic signatures near OLR and ILR.\nThe effects of these resonances may be observable far from the peak density of\nthe pattern and relatively nearby the solar position. The details of the\nkinematic signatures depend on the evolutionary history of the `bar' and\ntherefore velocity data, both systemic and velocity dispersion, may be used to\nprobe the evolutionary history as well as the present state of the Galaxy.\nKinematic models for a variety of simple scenarios are presented. Models with\nevolving pattern speeds show significantly stronger dispersion signatures than\nthose with static pattern speeds, suggesting that useful observational\nconstraints are possible. The models are applied to the proposed rotating\nspheroid and bar models; we find: 1) none of these models chosen to represent\nthe proposed large-scale rotating spheroid are consistent with the stellar\nkinematics; and 2) a Galactic bar with semimajor axis of $3\\kpc$ will cause a\nlarge increase in velocity dispersion in the vicinity of OLR ($\\sim5\\kpc$) with\nlittle change in the net radial motion and such a signature is suggested by\nK-giant velocity data.

Our G-matrices are calculated for the\nReid-soft-core potential in a harmonic oscillator basis. Single-particle ``-U''\ninsertions are replaced by two-particle ``-U'' insertions and are included in\nthe G matrix calculations, which sum them to all orders. With the starting\nenergy of the G-matrix chosen to give approximately the experimental binding\nenergy, we obtain nuclear energy spectra which are in reasonable agreement with\nexperiment. We also investigate the dependence of our results on the size of\nthe model space and on the harmonic oscillator basis parameter ($\\hbar\\Omega$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 1993 22:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

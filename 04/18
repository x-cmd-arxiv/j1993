Two of\nthese, a tilted spectrum and a gravitational wave contribution to COBE, are at\nsome level demanded by theory under the usual assumption that inflation\ngenerates the primeval perturbations. The third, whose motivation comes by\ncontrast from observation, is the introduction of a component of hot dark\nmatter to give the Mixed Dark Matter model. We discuss the implication of\ntaking these modifications together. Should Mixed Dark Matter prove necessary,\nvery strong constraints on inflationary models will ensue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 1993 09:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The uncertainty principle is expressed in this measure as $I\n\\ge 1$. For a harmonic oscillator in a thermal state, $I$ coincides with von\nNeumann entropy, $- \\Tr(\\rho \\ln \\rho)$, in the high-temperature regime, but\nunlike entropy, it is non-zero at zero temperature. It therefore supplies a\nnon-trivial measure of uncertainty due to both quantum and thermal\nfluctuations. We study $I$ as a function of time for a class of non-equilibrium\nquantum systems consisting of a distinguished system coupled to a heat bath. We\nderive an evolution equation for $I$. For the harmonic oscillator, in the\nFokker-Planck regime, we show that $I$ increases monotonically. For more\ngeneral Hamiltonians, $I$ settles down to monotonic increase in the long run,\nbut may suffer an initial decrease for certain initial states that undergo\n``reassembly'' (the opposite of quantum spreading). Our main result is to\nprove, for linear systems, that $I$ at each moment of time has a lower bound\n$I_t^{min}$, over all possible initial states. This bound is a generalization\nof the uncertainty principle to include thermal fluctuations in non-equilibrium\nsystems, and represents the least amount of uncertainty the system must suffer\nafter evolution in the presence of an environment for time $t$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 1993 13:32:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 1993 10:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 1993 10:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

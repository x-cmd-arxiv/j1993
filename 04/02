This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list. We use\nthe available data on the bursts' distribution of (the BATSE catalogue), and\nthe Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams (1992) to investigate\nwhether there is any observational indication for correlations between the\nangular distributions of bursts and comets' aphelia, assuming that the\ndistribution of aphelia direction reflect, at least to some extent, true\nvariations in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the V/V_{max}\ntest to both distributions. We have performed a variety of statistical tests (a\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a $\\chi^2$\ntest for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D cross-correlation analysis),\nincluding testing sub-samples for isolating the effect of possible\nobservational biases. These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two\ndistributions agree, but the statistical significance is not sufficient for\nruling out any connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo\nsimulations which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\\sim 800$\nit is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.\nCurrently, it is only the combination of these tests with the large\ndisagreement found for the V/V_{max} parameter which makes the Oort cloud of\ncomets unlikely to be related to gamma-ray bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 1993 23:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

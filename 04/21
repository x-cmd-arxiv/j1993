We show that in both models one can fix\nthese additional symmetries preserving the ISO(1,1) gauge symmetry and the\ndiffeomorphism invariance, so that, after a preliminary Dirac procedure, the\nremaining constraints uniquely satisfy the ISO(1,1) algebra. After the\nadditional symmetry is fixed, the equations of motion are unaltered. One thus\nremarkably simplifies the canonical structure, especially of the second model.\nMoreover, one shows that the Poincar\\'e group can always be used consistently\nas a gauge group for gravitational theories in two dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 1993 12:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

CT tests of QCD consist of production of the\nperturbative small-sized hadronic state and measuring the strngth of its\nnon-perturbative diffraction nteraction in a nuclear matter. The energy\ndepenednce of the final- state interaction in a nuclear matter probes a\ndynamical evolution from the perturbative small-sized state to the full-sized\nnonperturbative hadron. QCD observables of CT experiments correspond to a novel\nmechanism of scanning of hadronic wave functions from the large nonperturbative\nto the small perturbative size.

Relevance of these results to the vortices in the cosmos is pointed\nout.\n  NOTE: Just as \"negative energy solutions'' of Dirac equation are\nre-interpreted as antiparticles, similarly the possibility exists for\nre-interpreting the tachyonic dispersion relations of all (j,0)+(0,j)\nrepresentation spaces via spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking.

He has read\nand well assimilated the literature I suggested. Congratulations! This very new\nversion of the manuscript has now three authors and carries a very well chosen\ntitle.

The authors explain well the scope of their paper. They have made a\nthorough construction of a field theory of a non usual Wigner type; that is\ncompletely new and all references are relevant. {\\it This paper should be\npublished.}\" Despite the fact that no other report was received, the editors of\nPhys.

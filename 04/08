When we deform a generic\n$X$ into a degenerate $X_0$, the dimension of $F_X$ can jump. In this case,\nthere is a subscheme $F_{lim}$ of $F_{X_0}$ with the expected dimension which\nconsists of limiting $\\Bbb P^r$'s in $X_0$ with respect to a general\ndeformation. The simplest example is the well-known case of $27$ lines in a\ngeneric cubic surface.

The BRST quantizations of\ntopological G/H gauged WZW models (the twisted versions of SUSY gauged WZW\nmodels) are given under fixed back-ground gauge fields. The BRST-cohomology of\nthe system is investigated and the correlation functions among these physical\nobservables are considered under the instanton back-grounds. As a consequence,\ntwo-dimensional BF gauge theoretical aspects of TCFTs are revealed. Especially\nit is shown that two correlation functions under the different instanton\nback-grounds can change to each other. This process of transmutation is\ndescribed by the spectral flow. The flow is formulated as a \"singular\" gauge\ntransformation which creates an appropriate back-ground charge on the physical\nvacuum of the system. The field identification problem of the system is also\ndiscussed from the above point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 1993 12:54:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

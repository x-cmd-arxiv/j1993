The\nBethe Ansatz equations thus found are shown to be equivalent to those for a\nmixed spin model involving both 1/2 and infinite spin. This indicates that the\nNIS model provides a representation of the quantum group $SU(2)_{\\hat q}$\n($|\\hat q|\\not= 1$) corresponding to spins $s=1/2$ and $s=\\infty$.

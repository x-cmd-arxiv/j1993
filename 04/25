One can determine\non the basis of the Gibbs free energy which phase, nuclear or quark, is\nenergetically favorable. Using the nuclear equation of state of Wiringa, and a\nquark equation of state given by Freedman and McLerran, the allowed quark\nparameter space for such layer stars is searched. This paper differs from past\nwork in that configurations are found in which quark matter is located exterior\nand interior to shells of nuclear matter, i.e., dependent on quark parameters,\na star may contain several alternating layers of quark and nuclear matter.\nGiven the uncertainty in the quark parameter space, one can estimate the\nprobability for finding pure neutron stars, pure quark stars (strange stars),\nstars with a quark core and a nucleon exterior, or layer stars. Several layer\nmodels are presented. The physical characteristics, stability, and results of a\nthorough search of the quark parameter space are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 1993 21:07:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Apr 1993 23:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

In the absence of other new physics, non-observation of a\nlarge asymmetry can therefore be used to infer an upper bound on the mass scale\nfor new right-chiral weak vector bosons. Applying this idea to actual\nnucleon-nucleon scattering requires more involved calculations, as the dominant\ncontribution appears to come from a component of diquark-quark scattering\nrelated to, but not identical to, wavefunction-mixing. Earlier criticism of\nthis model by Simonius and Unger is refuted and a new calculation is proposed\nas an additional check on the result. Finally, we argue that the so-called\n`spin crisis' does not affect our conclusions.

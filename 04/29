Using an approximate energy functional\nconstructed from equilibrium solutions for polytropic binary configurations, we\nincorporate hydrodynamic effects into the calculation of the orbital decay\ndriven by gravitational wave emission. In particular, we follow the transition\nbetween the quasi-static, secular decay of the orbit at large separation and\nthe rapid dynamical evolution of configurations approaching contact. We show\nthat a purely Newtonian hydrodynamic instability can significantly accelerate\nthe coalescence at small separation. Such an instability occurs in all close\nbinary configurations containing sufficiently incompressible stars.\nCalculations are performed for various neutron star masses, radii, spins, and\neffective polytropic indices. Typically, we find that the radial infall\nvelocity just prior to contact is about 10\\% of the tangential orbital\nvelocity. Post-Newtonian effects can move the stability limit to a larger\nbinary separation, and may induce an even larger radial velocity. We also\nconsider the possibility of mass transfer from one neutron star to the other.\nWe show that stable mass transfer is impossible except when the mass of one of\nthe components is very small (less than about 0.4 solar mass) and the viscosity\nis high enough to maintain corotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 1993 18:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

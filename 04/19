The ``Copenhagen'' quantum mechanics of measured\nsubsystems incorporates a fundamental arrow of time. Extending discussions of\nAharonov, Bergmann and Lebovitz, Griffiths, and others we investigate a\ngeneralized quantum mechanics for cosmology that utilizes both an initial and a\nfinal density matrix to give a time-neutral formulation without a fundamental\narrow of time. Time asymmetries can arise for particular universes from\ndifferences between their initial and final conditions. Theories for both would\nbe a goal of quantum cosmology. A special initial condition and a final\ncondition of indifference would be sufficient to explain the observed time\nasymmetries of the universe. In this essay we ask under what circumstances a\ncompletely time symmetric universe, with T-symmetric initial and final\ncondition, could be consistent with the time asymmetries of the limited domain\nof our experience. We discuss the approach to equilibrium, the electromagnetic\nsystem, and T-violation in the weak interactions in such universes.\n  The decoherence of alternatives that is necessary for the prediction of\nprobabilities in the quantum mechanics of closed systems is the origin of a\nfundamental limitation on quantum cosmologies with initial and final\nconditions. The initial and final density matrices cannot both be pure; if they\nare there is no decoherence and no prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 1993 20:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2005 20:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

Since the only\npossible symmetries of this kind are known to be generation dependent, we\nexplore the possibility that the three sets of light states in each generation\ndo not have the same assignments with respect to the 27 of $E_6$, leading to\nnon universal gauge interactions under the additional $U(1)'$ factors for the\nknown fermions. We argue that models realising such a scenario are viable, with\ntheir structure being constrained mainly by the requirement of the absence of\nflavor changing neutral currents in the Higgs sector. Moreover, in contrast to\nthe standard case, rank 6 models are not disfavoured with respect to rank 5. By\nrequiring the number of light neutral states to be minimal, these models have\nan almost unique pattern of neutrino masses and mixings. We construct a model\nbased on the unconventional assignment scenario in which (with a natural choice\nof the parameters) $m_{\\nut}\\sim O(10)$eV is generated at one loop, $m_{\\num}$\nis generated at two loops and lies in a range interesting for the solar\nneutrino problem, and $\\nue$ remains massless.

To\nillustrate the non-standard phenomenology implied by our scheme we also discuss\na second scenario in which an attempt for solving the solar neutrino puzzle\nwith matter enhanced oscillations and practically massless neutrinos can be\nformulated, and in which peculiar effects for the $\\num$ --> $\\nut$ conversion\nof the upward-going atmospheric neutrinos could arise as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 1993 23:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 1993 00:40:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 1998 16:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

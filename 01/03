We present strong\nevidence that the free energy corresponds to a sum over branched surfaces with\nsmall handles mapped into the target space. The sum is modded out by all\ndiffeomorphisms on the world-sheet. This leaves a sum over disconnected classes\nof maps. We prove that the free energy gives a consistent result for all smooth\nmaps of the torus into the torus which cover the target space $p$ times, where\n$p$ is prime, and conjecture that this is true for all coverings. Each class\ncan also contain integrations over the positions of branch points and small\nhandles which act as ``moduli'' on the surface. We show that the free energy is\nconsistent for any number of handles and that the first few leading terms are\nconsistent with contributions from maps with branch points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 1993 23:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

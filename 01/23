The accuracy of our estimate is\ncontrolled by means of a small parameter $1/q$, analogous to the inverse spin\nmagnitude $1/s$ employed in studying quantum spin systems. The mathematical\naspects of the method and its connection with other large-spin approaches are\ndiscussed in details. In the large-$q$ limit the problem of strongly correlated\nelectron systems turns in the minimization of a total energy functional. We\nhave performed numerically this optimization problem on a finite but large\n$L\\times L$ lattice. For a single hole the static small-polaron solution is\nstable unless for small values of $J$, where polarons of increasing sizes have\nlower energy. At finite doping we recover phase separation above a critical $J$\nand for any electron density, showing that the Emery {\\it et al.} picture\nrepresents the semiclassical behaviour of the {\\it t}-{\\it J} model. Quantum\nfluctuations are expected to be very important especially in the small $J$ --\nsmall doping region, where phase separation may also be suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 1993 09:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

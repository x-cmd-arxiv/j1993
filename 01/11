Motivated by Doniach's work on the S=1/2 Kondo necklace,\nwe introduce the underscreened Kondo necklace models with S>1/2. The\nunderscreened Kondo necklace is the simplest lattice model on which the\ncompetition between Kondo spin compensation, and magnetic ordering due to an\nRKKY-type interaction can be examined. We used the mean-field approximation to\ndetermine the phase diagram, and found that the low-temperature phase is always\nan x-y antiferromagnet. This contention is further supported by the derivation\nof the exact form of the effective hamiltonian in the limit of very large Kondo\ncoupling: it is found to be an antiferromagnetic x-y model for the residual\n(S-1/2)-spins. In general, the degree of moment compensation depends on both\nthe Kondo coupling, and on S.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 1993 14:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

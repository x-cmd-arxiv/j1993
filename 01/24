We establish that any such change in the string\naction arises from a field transformation canonical with respect to the\nBatalin-Vilkovisky (BV) antibracket, and find the explicit form of the\ngenerator of the infinitesimal transformations. Two theories using different\ndecompositions of moduli space are shown to yield the same gauge fixed action\nupon use of different gauge fixing conditions. We also elaborate on recent work\non the covariant BV formalism, and emphasize the necessity of a measure in the\nspace of two dimensional field theories in order to extend a recent analysis of\nbackground independence to quantum string field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 1993 18:27:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 1993 19:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

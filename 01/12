These quantum fluctuations break the scale invariance of\nclassical QCD and give rise to an instanton interaction and this causes the\ninstantons to condense and form a homogeneous instanton solid. Such the\ninstanton solids show up in the field strength approach as homogeneous\n(constant up to gauge transformations) vacuum solutions. A new class of SU(N)\ninstantons is presented which are not embeddings of SU(N-1) instantons but have\nnon-trivial SU(N) color structure and carry winding number $n=N(N^{2}-1)/6$.\nThese instantons generate (after condensation) the lowest action solutions of\nthe field strength approach. The statistical weight (entropy) of different\nhomogeneous solutions for SU(3) is numerically estimated by Parisi's stochastic\nquantization method.

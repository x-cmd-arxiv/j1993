To resolve this\ninconsistency I suggest the presence of two populations, one at cosmological\ndistances and the other Galactic. I build on ideas of Shemi and Piran (1990)\nand of M\\'esz\\'aros and Rees (1993) involving the interaction of fireball\ndebris with surrounding clouds to explain the observed intensity histories in\nbursts at cosmological distances. The distances to the Galactic population are\nundetermined because they are too few to affect the statistics of intensity and\ndirection; I explain them as resulting from magnetic reconnection in neutron\nstar magnetospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 1992 20:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

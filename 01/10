It\nis obtained by gauging an extension of the super-Poincar\\'e algebra in two\nspace-time dimensions. This algebra is obtained by an unconventional\ncontraction of the super de Sitter algebra. Besides the generators of the super\nde Sitter algebra it has one more fermionic generator and two more bosonic\ngenerators one of them being a central charge. The gauging of this algebra is\nperformed in the usual way. Unlike some proposals for a dilaton supergravity\ntheory we obtain a model which is non-local in the gravitino field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 1993 12:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

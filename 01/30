However, the coframe is not the true Yang--Mills type\ngauge field of the translations, since it lacks the inhomogeneous gradient term\nin the gauge transformations. By explicitly restoring this ``hidden\" piece\nwithin the framework of the affine gauge approach to gravity, one can avoid the\nmetric or coframe degeneracy which would otherwise interfere with the\nintegrations within the path integral.

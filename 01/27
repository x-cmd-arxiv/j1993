In this model, the\npositional disorder in the sample is ignored and the particles are placed on\nthe vertices of a square lattice. The inter-particle forces are modeled as\nlinear springs, with the only disorder in the system coming from a random\ndistribution of spring constants. Despite its apparent simplicity, this model\nis able to reproduce the complex frequency response seen in measurements of\nsound propagation in a granular system. In order to understand this behavior,\nthe role of the resonance modes of the system is investigated. Finally, this\nsimple model is generalized to include relaxation behavior in the force network\n-- a behavior which is also seen in real granular materials. This model gives\nquantitative agreement with experimental observations of relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 1993 22:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

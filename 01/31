The geometrical\naction obtained is relevant to both $w$ gravity and 2D turbulence. For the\nlatter we describe the hamiltonian, which appears to be given by the Schwinger\nmass term, and discuss some possible developments within our approach. Next we\nshow that the set of highest weight orbits of $w_{\\infty}$ splits into subsets,\neach of which consists of highest weight orbits of $\\bar{w}_N$ for a given N.\nWe specify the general APD geometric action to an orbit of $\\bar{w}_N$ and\ndescribe an appropriate set of observables, thus getting an action and\nobservables for $\\bar{w}_N$ gravity. We compute also the Ricci form on the\n$\\bar{w}_N$ orbits, what gives us the critical central charge of the\n$\\bar{w}_N$ string, which appears to be the same as the one of the $W_N$\nstring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 1993 18:39:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 1993 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

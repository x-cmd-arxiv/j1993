In these scenarios, it is envisioned that the universe is nearly\nhomogeneous at the time of last scattering and that perturbations grow rapidly\nsometime after the primordial plasma recombines. On this basis, it was\nsuggested that large inhomogeneities could be generated while leaving\nrelatively little imprint on the cosmic microwave background (MBR) anisotropy.\nIn this paper, we calculate the minimal anisotropies possible in any\n``late-time'' scenario for structure formation, given the level of\ninhomogeneity observed at present. Since the growth of the inhomogeneity\ninvolves time-varying gravitational fields, these scenarios inevitably generate\nsignificant MBR anisotropy via the Sachs-Wolfe effect. Moreover, we show that\nthe large-angle MBR anisotropy produced by the rapid post-recombination growth\nof inhomogeneity is generally greater than that produced by the same\ninhomogeneity grown via gravitational instability. In ``realistic'' scenarios\none can decrease the anisotropy compared to models with primordial adiabatic\nfluctuations, but only on very small angular scales. The value of any\nparticular measure of the anisotropy can be made small in late-time models, but\nonly by making the time-dependence of the gravitational field sufficiently\n``pathological''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 1993 19:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

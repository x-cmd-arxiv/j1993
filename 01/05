Moreover the\nconstant $a$, relevant for the problem of Borel summability, was determined for\nall one-matrix models. We here obtain a set of equations for this constant in\nthe general $(p,q)$ model. String equations can be derived from the\nconstruction of two differential operators $P,Q$ satisfying canonical\ncommutation relations $[P,Q]=1$. We show that the equation for $a$ is\ndetermined by the form of the operators $P,Q$ in the spherical or semiclassical\nlimits. The results for the general one-matrix models are then easily\nrecovered. Moreover, since for the $(p,q)$ string models such $p=(2m+1)q\\pm1$\nthe semiclassical forms of $P,Q$ are explicitly known, the large order\nbehaviour is completely determined. This class contains all unitary $(q+1,q)$\nmodels for which the answer is specially simple.

In this\npaper we describe, among other things, the geometry of the embedding of the\nminimal bielliptic surfaces. A consequence of this description will be the\nexistence of smooth nonminimal bielliptic surfaces of degree 15 in $\\PP^4$. We\nalso explain how to construct the degree 15 surfaces with the help of the\nquadro-cubic Cremona transformation of $\\PP^4$. Finally, we remark that the\nquintic elliptic scroll and the abelian and bielliptic surfaces of degree 10\nand 15 are essentially the only smooth irregular surfaces known in $\\PP^4$ (all\nothers can be derived via finite morphisms $\\PP^4\\to\\PP^4 $).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 1993 11:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

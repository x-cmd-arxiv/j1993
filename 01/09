We define from the free\nenergy a function $C$ of the coupling constants and the temperature, which in\nthe regimes where quantum fluctuations dominate, is a monotonically increasing\nfunction of the temperature. We show that at very low temperatures the system\nis controlled by the zero-temperature infrared stable fixed point while at\nintermediate temperatures the behavior is that of the unstable fixed point. The\n$C$ function displays this crossover explicitly. This behavior is reminiscent\nof Zamolodchikov's $C$-theorem of field theories in 1+1 dimensions. Our results\nare obtained through a thermodynamic renormalization group approach. We find\nrestrictions on the behavior of the entropy of the system for a\n$C$-theorem-type behavior to hold. We illustrate our ideas in the context of a\nfree massive scalar field theory, the one-dimensional quantum Ising Model and\nthe quantum Non-linear Sigma Model in two space dimensions. In regimes in which\nthe classical fluctuations are important the monotonic behavior is absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 1993 22:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

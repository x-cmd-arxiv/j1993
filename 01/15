We consider extensions of this\nresult to partitions of infinite increasing sequences of reals. We show, that\nfor any Borel or even analytic partition of all increasing sequences of reals\nthere is a perfect set P such that all strongly increasing sequences from P lie\nin the same class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 1993 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

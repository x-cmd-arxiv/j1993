The lines arise in\nwarm gas with T > 40 K. The line brightness temperature is > 160 K in the di-\nrection of theta 1C, more than twice the dust temperature, and still exceeds 35\nK more than a parsec east of theta 1C. The lines are narrow, with a max- imum\nvelocity width of 7 km s^-1 near theta 1C and decreasing to 1.5-3 km s^-1 at\nthe map boundaries. The density of the emitting gas is > 10^4 cm^-3 and the\ncolumn density exceeds 10^21 cm^-2. The correlation of the bright, narrow\nCO(7-6) lines with 158 micron [C II] emission suggests that over the entire\nregion mapped, the narrow CO lines arise in warm photo-dissociation regions ex-\ncited by UV photons from the Trapezium cluster. Although the Trapezium stars\nlie in front of the Orion A molecular cloud, not all of the warm gas is at the\ncloud surface. To the east of theta 1C the CO(7-6) lines split into two velo-\ncity components (also seen in 13CO(2-1) emission) which persist over several\narcminutes. Since only one of these components can be on the surface, the other\nmust arise from a dense, UV-illuminated clump or filament within the molecular\ncloud. Comparison of the quiescent CO(7-6) emission to CO(7-6) ob- served in a\ncross-map of the energetic Orion KL outflow shows that the lumino- sity of\nshock-excited CO(7-6) emission in Orion is only a few percent of the luminosity\nof the widespread quiescent CO(7-6) emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 1993 21:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We analyse the consequences of the no\nboundary proposal, the only reasonably complete set of boundary conditions that\nhas been put forward. We study perturbations of a Friedmann model containing a\nmassive scalar field but our results should be independent of the details of\nthe matter content. We find that gravitational wave perturbations have an\namplitude that remains in the linear regime at all times and is roughly time\nsymmetric about the time of maximum expansion. Thus gravitational wave\nperturbations do not give rise to an Arrow of Time. However density\nperturbations behave very differently. They are small at one end of the\nuniverse's history, but grow larger and become non linear as the universe gets\nlarger. Contrary to an earlier claim, the density perturbations do not get\nsmall again at the other end of the universe's history. They therefore give\nrise to a Thermodynamic Arrow of Time that points in a constant direction while\nthe universe expands and contracts again. The Arrow of Time does not reverse at\nthe point of maximum expansion. One has to appeal to the Weak Anthropic\nPrinciple to explain why we observe the Thermodynamic Arrow to agree with the\nCosmological Arrow, the direction of time in which the universe is expanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 1993 16:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

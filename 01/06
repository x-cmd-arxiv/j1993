Since the two interferometers of the LIGO detector\nshare nearly the same orientation, their joint sensitivity is similar to that\nof a single, more sensitive interferometer. We express our results for a single\ninterferometer of both initial and advanced LIGO design, and also for the LIGO\ndetector in the limit that its two interferometers share exactly the same\norientation. We approximate the evolution of a binary system as driven\nexclusively by leading order quadrupole gravitational radiation.

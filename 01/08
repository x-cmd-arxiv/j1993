We show that the Balmer\nline fluxes and profile shapes undergo remarkable changes. The ratio of\nintensities between the broad and narrow components of Hbeta increased\nmonotonically from 15 in 1985 to 40 in 1991. The peak of the broad components\nof Hbeta and Halpha were known to be strongly displaced to the red. We have\ndiscovered a correlation between the amplitude of the broad peak displacement\nand the luminosity of Hbeta, in the sense that the displacement is larger when\nthe line luminosity is higher. We suggest that the observations are not\ncompatible with either a binary Broad Line Region model or one involving\nballistic acceleration of the line emitting gas. Radiative acceleration of a\nsystem of outflowing clouds readily explains the correlation between line shift\nand luminosity as well as the peculiar line profiles. Furthermore, it seems\nthat most or all of the Balmer emission originates from the inward face of the\nclouds. Theoretical line profiles suggest that the observed Hbeta profile is\nbest fit assuming the contribution of an ensemble which might be spherical or\nconfined in a thick disk in addition to a component emitted in a thin shell\ncontained in a cone of half opening angle 12 degrees seen along its axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 1993 17:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

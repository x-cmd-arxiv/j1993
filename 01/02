We derive scaling relations for the partition function and physical\nobservables in this conformal phase, and suggest quantitative tests of these\nrelations in numerical simulations of simplicial four geometries with $S^4$\ntopology. In particular, we predict the form of the critical curve in the\ncoupling constant plane, and determine the scaling of the Newtonian coupling\nwith volume which permits a sensible continuum limit. The existing numerical\nresults already provide some evidence of this new conformal invariant phase of\nquantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 1993 10:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

It is\nfound that when taking into account the effect due to internal quark structure\nof nucleons, the derived scaling variable for bound nucleons and the calculated\nnuclear structure functions are different from those in considering the\nbaryon-mesons as the effective elementary constituents. This implies that the\npure baryon-meson descriptions of nuclei give the inaccurate off-shell behavior\nof the bound nucleon structure function, thereby the quark-gluons seem to be\nthe most appropriate degrees of freedom for nuclear descriptions.

Without electron-electron interactions the ground state is a single\nSlater determinant corresponding to a droplet centered on the minimum of the\nconfinement potential and occupying the minimum area allowed by the Pauli\nexclusion principle. Electron-electron interactions favor droplets of larger\narea. We derive exact criteria for the stability of the maximum density droplet\nagainst edge excitations and against the introduction of holes in the interior\nof the droplet. The possibility of obtaining exact results in the strong\nmagnetic field is related to important simplifications associated with broken\ntime-reversal symmetry in a strong magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 1993 16:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

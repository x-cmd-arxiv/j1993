The initial rapid growth of the\nnucleus, due mainly to massive clusters on box orbits falling in a short time\nscale into the galactic centre, is found to be later slowed by tidal disruption\ninduced by the nucleus itself on less massive clusters in the way described by\nOstriker, Binney & Saha.\n  The efficiency of dynamical friction is such to carry to the centre of the\ngalaxy enough globular cluster mass available to form a compact nucleus, but\nthe actual modes of its collisionless formation remains to be investigated.\n  The mass of the resulting nucleus is determined by the mutual feedback of the\ntwo mentioned processes, together with the knowlegde of the initial spatial,\nvelocity and mass distributions of the globular cluster family. Moreover, we\ndiscuss the possibility that the globular cluster fall to the galactic centre\nhas been cause of primordial violent galactic activity.\n  An application of the model to M31 is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 1993 15:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Probabilities are computed by\nsumming the squares of amplitudes over alternatives which could have been\nmeasured but weren't. Measurements are limited by uncertainty principles and by\nother restrictions arising from the principles of quantum mechanics. This essay\nexamines the extent to which those features of the quantum mechanics of\nmeasured subsystems that are explicitly tied to measurement situations are\nincorporated or modified in the more general quantum mechanics of closed\nsystems in which measurement is not a fundamental notion. There, probabilities\nare predicted for decohering sets of alternative time histories of the closed\nsystem, whether or not they represent a measurement situation. Reduction of the\nstate vector is a necessary part of the description of such histories.\nUncertainty principles limit the possible alternatives at one time from which\nhistories may be constructed.

Coordinate\ntransformations which define orbifolds are modified at quantum level. Wave\nfunctions of twisted strings in general acquire nontrivial phases when they\nmove around non-contractible loops on orbifolds. Zero mode eigenvalues are\nshifted from naively expected values, in favor of modular invariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 1993 10:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}

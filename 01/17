They may be remnants of the\nspontaneous breaking of an SU(2) X SU(2) X U(1) gauge symmetry at a much higher\nenergy scale. In one case, the two-doublet Higgs potential has a custodial\nSU(2) symmetry and implies an observable scalar triplet. In another, a light\nneutral scalar becomes possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 1993 21:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

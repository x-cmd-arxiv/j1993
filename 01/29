At low coverage, ordered Pb islands with a\nlarge square unit cell and nearly hexagonal internal structure are formed. This\nis a high order commensurate phase with 30 atoms in the unit cell. From the\nmeasurement of the island diffraction peak profiles we find a power law for the\nmean island - size versus coverage with an exponent $n=0.54 \\pm 0.03$. A\nscaling behavior of growth is confirmed and a simple model describing island\ngrowth is presented. Due to the high degeneracy of the monolayer phase,\ndifferent islands do not diffract coherently. Therefore, when islands merge\nthey still diffract as separate islands and coalescence effects are thus\nnegligible. From the result for $n$ we conclude that the island density is\napproximately a constant in the coverage range $0.1 < \\Theta < 0.5$ where the\nordered islands are observed. We thus conclude that most islands nucleate at\n$\\Theta < 0.1$ and then grow in an approximately self similar fashion as\n$\\Theta$ increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 1993 16:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

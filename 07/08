A brief introduction to $\\phi^4$\ntheory in four dimensions and the path integral formulation for fermions is\ngiven. The strategy is as follows. First, the modes on either side of the Fermi\nsurface within a cut-off $\\Lambda$ are chosen and a path integral is written to\ndescribe them. An RG transformation which eliminates a part of these modes, but\npreserves the action of the noninteracting system is identified. Finally the\npossible perturbations of this free-field fixed point are classified as\nrelevant, irrelevant or marginal. A $d=1$ warmup calculation involving a system\nof fermions shows how, in contrast to mean-field theory, the RG correctly\nyields a scale invariant system (Luttinger liquid) In $d=2$ and 3, for\nrotationally invariant Fermi surfaces, {\\em automatically} leads to Landau's\nFermi liquid theory, which appears as a fixed point characterized by an\neffective mass and a Landau function $F$, with the only relevant perturbations\nbeing of the superconducting (BCS) type The functional flow equations for the\nBCS couplings are derived and separated into an infinite number of flows, one\nfor each angular momentum.

It is known that such\nan approximation scheme produces the appearance of ghost poles in the\npropagators.

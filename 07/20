Such strings were originally proposed as a possible candidate for\nthe QCD string. Our approach is different from previous ones and is simple and\ngeneral enough, with which basic problems can be easily addressed. The Green\nfunction on a surface with Dirichlet boundaries is obtained through the Neumann\nGreen function on the same surface, by employing a simple approach to Dirichlet\nconditions. An easy consequence of the simple calculation of the Green function\nis that in the simplest model, namely the bosonic Dirichlet string, the\ncritical dimension is still 26, and the tachyon is still present in the\nspectrum, while the scattering amplitudes differ dramatically from those in the\nusual string theory. We discuss the high energy, fixed angle behavior of the\nfour point scattering amplitudes on the disk and the annulus.

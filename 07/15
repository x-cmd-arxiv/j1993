The work builds on previous\nstudies using the same model; here the part of the parity-violating asymmetry\nthat contains axial-vector hadronic currents is developed in detail using those\nprevious studies and a link is provided to the transverse vector-isovector\nresponse. Various integrated observables are constructed from the differential\nasymmetry. These include an asymmetry averaged over the quasielastic peak, as\nwell as the difference of the asymmetry integrated to the left and right of the\npeak -- the latter is shown to be optimal for bringing out the nature of the\npionic correlations. Special weighted integrals involving the differential\nasymmetry and electromagnetic cross section, based on the concepts of y-scaling\nand sum rules, are constructed and shown to be suited to studies of the\nsingle-nucleon form factor content in the problem, in particular, to\ndeterminations of the isovector/axial-vector and electric strangeness form\nfactors. Comparisons are also made with recent predictions made on the basis of\nrelativistic mean-field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 1993 16:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The\nsimulation shows that dense cores are produced with a semi-regular interval in\nspace and time from one edge to the other. At the initial stage the gas near\none of the edges is attracted inwards by gravity and the accumulation of the\ngas makes a dense core near the edge. When the dense core grows in mass up to a\ncertain amount, it gathers gas from the other direction. Accordingly the dense\ncore becomes isolated from the main cloud and the parent filamentary cloud has\na new edge. This cycle repeats and the fragmentation process propagates towards\nthe other edge. The propagation speed is a few tens of percent larger than the\nsound speed. According to the theory, the age difference for the northwest-most\nand southeast-most cores in TMC-1 is estimated to be 0.68~pc/0.6~km~s$^{-1}$ =\n$ 10 ^6 $~y.

The new treatment is based on an analysis of the probability\ndistribution of the end-to-end distance of a randomly chosen segment of\nleft-moving string of given length. The description involves three distinct\nlength scales: $\\xi$, related to the overall string density, $\\bar\\xi$, the\npersistence length along the string, and $\\zeta$, describing the small-scale\nstructure, which is an important feature of the numerical simulations that have\nbeen done of this problem. An evolution equation is derived describing how the\ndistribution develops in time due to the combined effects of the universal\nexpansion, of intercommuting and loop formation, and of gravitational\nradiation. With plausible assumptions about the unknown parameters in the\nmodel, we confirm the conclusions of our previous study, that if gravitational\nradiation and small-scale structure effects are neglected, the two dominant\nlength scales both scale in proportion to the horizon size. When the extra\neffects are included, we find that while $\\xi$ and $\\bar\\xi$ grow, $\\zeta$\ninitially does not. Eventually, however, it does appear to scale, at a much\nlower level, due to the effects of gravitational back-reaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 1993 14:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

We prove that this tensor product is associative and symmetric up to\nequivalence. We also determine explicitly the action of ${\\cal A}$ on it, under\nwhich the central extension is preserved. \\\\ Having given a precise meaning to\nfusion, determining the fusion rules is now a well-posed algebraic problem,\nnamely to decompose the tensor product into irreducible representations. We\ndemonstrate how to solve it for the case of the WZW- and the minimal models and\nrecover thereby the well-known fusion rules. \\\\ The action of the symmetry\nalgebra on the tensor product is given in terms of a comultiplication. We\ncalculate the $R$-matrix of this comultiplication and find that it is\ntriangular. This seems to shed some new light on the possible r\\^{o}le of the\nquantum group in conformal field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 1993 15:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

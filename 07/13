We consider histories characterized by position samplings at $n$\nmoments of time. We use this to construct a probability distribution on the\nvalue of (discrete approximations to) the field equations, $F = m \\ddot x +\nV'(x) $, at $n-2$ times. We find that it is peaked around $F=0$; thus classical\ncorrelations are exhibited.

We determine the modifications to this result when the system is\ncoupled to a thermal environment. We show that the thermal fluctuations become\ncomparable with the quantum fluctuations under the same conditions that\ndecoherence effects come into play. We also study an alternative measure of\nclassical correlations, namely the conditional probability of finding a\nsequence of position samplings, given that particular initial phase space data\nhave occurred.

Yet, in a momentum\nexpansion one is able to extract definite, testable predictions from\nperturbation theory. These techniques have yielded in recent years a wealth of\ninformation on many problems where the physics of Goldstone bosons plays a\ncrucial role, but theoretical issues concerning chiral perturbation theory\nremain, to this date, poorly treated in the literature. We present here a\nrather comprehensive analysis of the regularization and renormalization\nambiguities appearing in chiral perturbation theory at the one loop level. We\ndiscuss first on the relevance of dealing with tadpoles properly. We\ndemonstrate that Ward identities severely constrain the choice of regulators to\nthe point of enforcing unique, unambiguous results in chiral perturbation\ntheory at the one-loop level for any observable which is renormalization-group\ninvariant. We comment on the physical implications of these results and on\nseveral possible regulating methods that may be of use for some applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 1993 12:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

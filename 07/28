We discuss the two\nmain parameters of the problem, \\ie the radiation field and the halo pressure,\nin the framework of the current models for the halo/disk interaction. We find a\nwell defined relation between a critical column density at which the cloud\nstarts to develop a cold central core with the cloud linear size. Making use of\nthis relation, we suggest a straightforward method to derive the distance to\nthe cloud. We discuss the possible sources of error in this determination and\nit is found that the method is particularly suitable for those clouds which are\nsubsonic with respect to the surrounding medium, while for the supersonic ones,\nthe method can only give a lower limit to the distance. The H$\\alpha$ emission\nfrom the partially ionized edge of the cloud is calculated and compared with\nthe available observations; this measure is a powerful indicator of the\npossible presence of a shock in the cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 1993 07:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

As examples we give the structure\nconstants C_{33}^4 and C_{44}^4 for the algebras of type W(2,3,4,...) (that\ninclude the WA_{n-1}-algebras) and the structure constant C_{44}^4 for the\nalgebras of type W(2,4,...), especially for all the algebras WD_n, WB(0,n),\nWB_n and WC_n. It also includes the bosonic projection of the super-Virasoro\nalgebra and a yet unexplained algebra of type W(2,4,6) found previously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 1993 10:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

While in standard grand unified theories these effects can be\nestimated easily, the corresponding calculations are quite complicated in\nstring unified theories and do exist only in models with unbroken $E_6$. We\npresent results for heavy particle thresholds in more realistic models with\ngauge group $SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$. Effects of Wilson line background\nfields as well as the universal part of the (rather mild) threshold corrections\nindicate a strong model dependence.

Using real space\nrenormalisation group arguments we discuss the precise criteria for determining\nthe entire spertrum of extended eigenstates and the corresponding\neigenfunctions in disordered as well as quasiperiodic systems. For purposes of\nillustration we calculate a few selected eigenvalues and the corresponding\nextended eigenfunctions for the quasiperiodic copper-mean chain. So far, for\nthe infinite copper-mean chain, only a single energy has been numerically shown\nto support an extended eigenstate [ You et al. (1991)] : we show analytically\nthat there is in fact an infinite number of extended eigenstates in this\nlattice which form fragmented minibands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jul 1993 18:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We then compute the loop\nperturbatively, both on a flat background and in the presence of an external\nsource; we also allow some modifications in the form of the action, and test\nthe action of ``stabilized'' gravity. A geometrical analysis of the results in\nterms of the gauge group of the euclidean theory, $SO(4)$, leads us to the\nconclusion that the correspondent statistical system does not develope any\nconfiguration with localized curvature at low temperature. This ``non-local''\nbehavior of the quantized gravitational field strongly contrasts with that of\nusual gauge fields.

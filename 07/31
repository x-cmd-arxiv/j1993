In this\ncontext, the Mirror Symmetry phenomenon can be interpreted as the following\ntwofold characterization of the series $\\Phi_0$. First, $\\Phi_0$ is defined by\nintersection numbers of rational curves in ${\\bf P}_{\\Sigma}$ with the\nhypersurfaces $V_i$ and their toric degenerations. Second, $\\Phi_0$ is the\npower expansion near a boundary point of the moduli space of the monodromy\ninvariant period of the holomorphic differential $d$-form on an another\nCalabi-Yau $d$-fold $V'$ which is called Mirror of $V$. Using the generalized\nhypergeometric series, we propose a general construction for Mirrors $V'$ of\n$V$ and canonical $q$-coordinates on the moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 1993 18:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

A formal proof of this conjecture,\nusing Lorentzian signature techniques, has recently been provided by Wald. This\nnote performs two functions. Firstly, a rather different proof of this result\nis presented --- a proof based on Euclidean signature techniques. The total\nentropy is S = 1/4 {k A_H / l_P^2} + \\int_H {S} \\sqrt{g} d^2x. The integration\nruns over a spacelike cross-section of the event horizon H. The surface entropy\ndensity, {S}, is related to the behaviour of the matter Lagrangian under time\ndilations. Secondly, I shall consider the specific case of Einstein-Hilbert\ngravity coupled to an effective Lagrangian that is an arbitrary function of the\nRiemann tensor (though not of its derivatives). In this case a more explicit\nresult is obtained S = 1/4 {k A_H / l_P^2} + 4 pi {k/hbar} \\int_H {partial L /\npartial R_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\rho}} g^\\perp_{\\mu\\lambda} g^\\perp_{\\nu\\rho} \\sqrt{g}\nd^2x .

The new ingredient, with respect to the standard\ntheory of photon--photon scattering in vacuum, is the presence of low--energy,\nnonrelativistic electron--hole excitations. Owing to the existence of\ntwo--photon vertices, the scattering processes in the metal are predominantly\nof second order, as opposed to fourth order for the vacuum case. The main\nprocesses in second order are dominated by exchange of virtual plasmons between\nthe two photons. For two photons of similar energy $\\hbar \\Omega$, this gives\nrise to a cross section rising like $\\Omega^2$ up to maximum of around\n$10^{-32}$~cm$^2$, and then decreasing like $\\Omega^{-6}$. The maximal cross\nsection is found for the photon wavevector $k \\sim k_{F}$, the Fermi surface\nsize, which typically means a photon energy $\\hbar \\Omega$ in the keV range.\nPossible experiments aimed at checking the existence of these rare but\nseemingly measurable elastic photon--photon scattering processes are discussed,\nusing in particular intense synchrotron sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 1993 17:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

Simple 2D\nshort-range lattice model hamiltonians are constructed, keeping in mind the\nphenomenology of real perovskite systems, like $SrTiO_{3}$ and $KTaO_{3}$.\nPertinent quantum tunneling phenomena, and the presence of an ice-like\nconstraint are demonstrated. The two simplest models, namely a plain quantum\nfour-state clock model, and a constrained one, are then studied in some detail.\nWe show the equivalence of the former, but not of the latter, to a quantum\nIsing model. For the latter, we describe a very good analytical wavefunction\nvalid in the special case of zero coupling ($J = 0$). In order to study the\nfull quantum statistical mechanics of both models, a Path Integral Monte Carlo\ncalculation is set up, and implemented with a technique, which even in the\nconstrained case permits a good convergence for increasing time slice number\n$m$. The method is applied first to the unconstrained model, which serves as a\ncheck, and successively to the constrained quantum four-state clock model. It\nis found that in both cases, a quantum phase transition still takes place at\nfinite coupling J, between a ferroelectric and a quantum paraelectric state,\neven when the constraint hinders disordering of the ferroelectric state. This\nmodel paraelectric state has a finite excitation gap, and no broken symmetry.\nThe possible role of additional (\"oxygen hopping\") kinetic terms in making\ncloser contact with the known phenomenology of $SrTiO_{3}$ is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 1993 17:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-14"}

The correlation length is\nmuch smaller than the scale of the heart, suggesting that many independent\nregions of activity exist on the epicardium at any one time.

These results imply that the heart behaves\nduring VF as a high-dimensional, but not random, system involving many spatial\ndegrees of freedom, which may explain the lack of convergence of fractal\ndimension estimates reported in the literature.

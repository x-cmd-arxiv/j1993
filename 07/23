Our method is based\non the use of ellipsoidal trial functions in an energy variational principle.\nWe consider both synchronized and nonsynchronized systems, constructing the\ncompressible generalizations of the classical Darwin and Darwin-Riemann\nconfigurations. Our method can be applied to a wide variety of binary models\nwhere the stellar masses, radii, spins, entropies, and polytropic indices are\nall allowed to vary over wide ranges and independently for each component. We\nfind that both secular and dynamical instabilities can develop before a Roche\nlimit or contact is reached along a sequence of models with decreasing binary\nseparation. High incompressibility always makes a given binary system more\nsusceptible to these instabilities, but the dependence on the mass ratio is\nmore complicated. As simple applications, we construct models of double\ndegenerate systems and of low-mass main-sequence-star binaries. We also discuss\nthe orbital evolution of close binary systems under the combined influence of\nfluid viscosity and secular angular momentum losses from processes like\ngravitational radiation. We show that the existence of global fluid\ninstabilities can have a profound effect on the terminal evolution of\ncoalescing binaries. The validity of our analytic solutions is examined by\nmeans of detailed comparisons with the results of recent numerical fluid\ncalculations in three dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 1993 16:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

(2) Initial density\nmaxima are not generally the sites where collapse first occurs. (3) Initially\nunderdense regions may undergo collapse if the shear is not too small. If the\nmagnetic part of the Weyl tensor vanishes, the nonlinear evolution is described\npurely locally by our equations; this condition holds for spherical,\ncylindrical, and planar perturbations and may be a good approximation in other\ncircumstances.

The momentum-dependent\nparametrizations are shown to be valid up to about 1 GeV/u for the empirical\nproton-nucleus optical potential. We perform numerical simulations for\nheavy-ion collisions within the RBUU-approach adopting momentum-dependent and\nmomentum-independent mean-fields and calculate the transverse flow in and\nperpendicular to the reaction plane, the directivity distribution as well as\nsubthreshold K+-production. By means of these observables we discuss the\nparticular role of the momentum-dependent forces and their implications on the\nnuclear equation of state. We find that only a momentum-dependent parameter-set\ncan explain the experimental data on the transverse flow in the reaction plane\nfrom 150 - 1000 MeV/u and the differential K+-production cross sections at 1\nGeV/u at the same time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 1993 15:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

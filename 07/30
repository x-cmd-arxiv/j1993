This is due to the combined\neffects of abberation, an anisotropic shift of the burst event rate, and an\nangular variation in the distance out to which bursts can be detected.\n  We derive the amplitude of the expected dipole for an open and flat\ncosmological model, and for various possible evolution rates of the burst\npopulation. Although our dimensionless velocity with respect to the CMB rest\nframe is of order $10^{-3}$, the dipole amplitude is of order $10^{-2}$, an\norder of magnitude larger. The results depend very weakly on the value of\n$\\Omega_0$, but are sensitive to the spectral index of the bursts' photon\nspectra, and to the rate of evolution of the burst population. There is no\ndependence on the value of the Hubble constant.\n  A clear detection of the dipole will require a larger sample of bursts than\ncurrently available (of order $10^4$). Future statistical analyses of the\nhypothesis that bursts originate at cosmological distances should take this\neffect into account, rather than assuming a perfectly isotropic distribution,\nfor obtaining the correct statistical significance of their results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 1993 16:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

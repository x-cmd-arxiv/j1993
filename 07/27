It is noted that the\nmoduli space for $N$ vortices, which is the same as that of $N$\nindistinguishable points on a torus, fibrates into a $CP_{N-1}$ bundle over the\nJacobi manifold of the torus. The volume of the moduli space is a product of\nthe area of the base of this bundle and the volume of the fibre. These two\nvalues are determined by considering two 2-surfaces in the bundle corresponding\nto a rigid motion of a vortex configuration, and a motion around a fixed centre\nof mass. The partition function for the vortices is proportional to the volume\nof the moduli space, and the equation of state for the vortices is $P(A-4\\pi\nN)=NT$ in the thermodynamic limit, where $P$ is the pressure, $A$ the area of\nthe region of the plane occupied by the vortices, and $T$ the temperature.\nThere is no phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jul 1993 13:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

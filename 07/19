We\nshow by numerical calculation that the solar neutrino flux, being sensitive to\nthe twist, could exhibit observable seasonal oscillation, provided that the\ntwist is sizable in magnitude and the neutrinos have reasonably large magnetic\nmoments. This oscillation is ascribed to the fact that the earth's orbit is\nslightly inclined to the sun's equator, and that solar neutrinos pass through\nthe northern (southern) hemisphere of the sun around September (March).

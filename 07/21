An equation of motion for the interface is\nderived in two steps. First, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is\nused to derive a diffusion equation for the magnetic field in the normal phase,\nwith nonlinear boundary conditions at the interface. These boundary conditions\nare a continuity equation which relates the gradient of the field at the\ninterface to the normal velocity of the interface, and a modified Gibbs-Thomson\nboundary condition for the field at the interface. Second, the boundary\nintegral method is used to integrate out the magnetic field in favor of an\nequation of motion for the interface. This equation of motion, which is highly\nnonlinear and nonlocal, exhibits a diffusive instability (the Mullins-Sekerka\ninstability) when the superconducting phase expands into the normal phase\n(i.e., when the external field is reduced below the critical field). In the\nlimit of infinite diffusion constant the equation of motion becomes local in\ntime, and can be derived variationally from a static energy functional which\nincludes the bulk free energy difference between the two phases, the\ninterfacial energy, and a long range self-interaction of the interface of the\nBiot-Savart form.

A Chapman-Enskog expansion of the PDE system predicts\nthat the macroscopic behavior corresponds to the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations with additional terms of order Mach number squared. We introduce a\nfourth-order scheme and compare results with those of the commonly used lattice\nBoltzmann discretization and with finite-difference schemes applied to the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations in primitive-variable form. We\nnumerically demonstrate convergence of the BGK schemes to the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations and quantify the errors associated with compressibility\nand discretization effects. When compressibility error is smaller than\ndiscretization error, convergence in both grid spacing and time step is shown\nto be second-order for the LB method and is confirmed to be fourth-order for\nthe fourth-order BGK solver. However, when the compressibility error is\nsimultaneously reduced as the grid is refined, the LB method behaves as a\nfirst-order scheme in time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 1993 17:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

If the tau neutrino\ndoes have a small electric charge, and its mass is greater than 1 MeV, then it\ncan annihilate sufficiently in the early Universe by electromagnetic\ninteractions to avoid conflict with the standard cosmology model.

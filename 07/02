The Pauli-Villars fields are\nmassive particles coupled to gravity in a covariant and nonminimal way, namely\none real tensor and one complex vector. The gauge is fixed by means of the\nunusual gauge-fixing that gives the same effective action as in the context of\nthe background field method. Indeed, with the background field method it is\nsimple to see that the regularization effectively works. On the other hand, we\nshow that in the usual formalism (non background) the regularization cannot\nwork with each gauge-fixing.In particular, it does not work with the usual one.\nMoreover, we show that, under a suitable choice of the Pauli-Villars\ncoefficients, the terms divergent in the Pauli-Villars masses can be corrected\nby the Pauli-Villars fields themselves. In dimension four, there is no need to\nadd counterterms quadratic in the curvature tensor to the Einstein action\n(which would be equivalent to the introduction of new coupling constants). The\ntechnique also works when matter is coupled to gravity. We discuss the possible\nconsequences of this approach, in particular the renormalization of Newton's\ncoupling constant and the appearance of two parameters in the effective action,\nthat seem to have physical implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 1993 12:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

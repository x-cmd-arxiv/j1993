We evaluate the\ngluon propagator both in time at zero 3-momentum and in momentum space. From\nthe former quantity we obtain evidence for a dynamically generated effective\nmass, which at beta=6.0 and beta=6.3 increases with the time separation of the\nsources, in agreement with earlier results. The momentum space propagator G(k)\nprovides further evidence for mass generation. In particular, at beta=6.0, for\nk less than 1 GeV, the propagator G(k) can be fit to a continuum formula\nproposed by Gribov and others, which contains a mass scale b, presumably\nrelated to the hadronization mass scale. For higher momenta Gribov's model no\nlonger provides a good fit, as G(k) tends rather to follow an inverse power\nlaw. The results at beta=6.3 are consistent with those at beta=6.0, but only\nthe high momentum region is accessible on this lattice. We find b in the range\nof three to four hundred MeV and the exponent of the inverse power law about\n2.7. On the other hand, at beta=5.7 (where we can only study momenta up to 1\nGeV) G(k) is best fit to a simple massive boson propagator with mass m. We\nargue that such a discrepancy may be related to a lack of scaling for low\nmomenta at beta=5.7. {}From our results, the study of correlation functions in\nmomentum space looks promising, especially because the data points in Fourier\nspace turn out to be much less correlated than in real space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 1993 20:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

These models can be fully parametrized in terms of\nthe top-quark mass, the ratio $\\tan\\beta=v_2/v_1$, and three supersymmetry\nbreaking parameters ($m_{1/2},m_0,A$). The latter are chosen in the minimal\n$SU(5)$ model such that the stringent constraints from proton decay and\ncosmology are satisfied. In the flipped $SU(5)$ case we consider two\nstring-inspired supersymmetry breaking scenaria: $SU(N,1)$ no-scale\nsupergravity and a dilaton-induced supersymmetry breaking scenario. Both imply\nuniversal soft supersymmetry breaking parameters: $m_0=A=0$ and\n$m_0=\\coeff{1}{\\sqrt{3}}m_{1/2}, A=-m_{1/2}$ respectively. We present a\ncomparative study of the sparticle and Higgs spectra of both flipped $SU(5)$\nmodels and the minimal $SU(5)$ model and conclude that all can be partially\nprobed at the Tevatron and LEPII (and the flipped models at HERA too).

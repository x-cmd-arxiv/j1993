A knot $K$ is\n{\\it slice} if $\\chi_s(K)=1$. Realize $D^4$ in $\\C^2$ as\n$\\{(z,w):|z|^2+|w|^2\\le1\\}$. It has been conjectured that, if $V$ is a\nnonsingular complex plane curve transverse to $S^3$, then $\\chi_s(V\\cap\nS^3)=\\chi(V\\cap D^4)$. Kronheimer and Mrowka have proved this conjecture in the\ncase that $V\\cap D^4$ is the Milnor fiber of a singularity. I explain how this\nseemingly special case implies both the general case and the ``slice-Bennequin\ninequality'' for braids. As applications, I show that various knots are not\nslice (e.g., pretzel knots like $\\Pscr(-3,5,7)$; all knots obtained from a\npositive trefoil $O\\{2,3\\}$ by iterated untwisted positive doubling). As a\nsidelight, I give an optimal counterexample to the ``topologically locally-flat\nThom conjecture''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 1993 00:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2000 23:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

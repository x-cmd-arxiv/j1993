In particular, we\nshow that large angle sterile neutrino mixing seems to be excluded as a MSW\nsolution to the solar neutrino situation or a solution to the atmospheric\nneutrino mixing hinted at in some underground experiments. We show how with\nthis constraint, the next generation of solar neutrino experiments should be\nable to determine the resolution of the solar neutrino problem. It is also\nshown how sterile neutrinos remain a viable dark matter candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 1993 21:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

It is pointed out that, although\nthe LRT theory of SR is by definition restricted to the small signal limit, it\npossesses substantial advantages in terms of simplicity, generality and\npredictive power. The application of LRT to overdamped motion in a bistable\npotential, the most commonly studied form of SR, is outlined. Two new forms of\nSR, predicted on the basis of LRT and subsequently observed in analogue\nelectronic experiments, are described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 1993 06:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

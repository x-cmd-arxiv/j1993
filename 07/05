Narrow-band\nfilter observations show that there are no H II regions within a 12 kpc radius\nof the line-of-sight to the quasar, at the velocities of three of the\nabsorbers. Broad-band imaging shows that there are no dwarf galaxies at Virgo\ndistances with absolute magnitude above MB~-13.5 and within a radius of 40 kpc.\nWe present fiber spectroscopy of galaxies within a radius of 1 deg, down to an\napparent magnitude of B~19. We show that the absorbers are definitely not\ndistributed at random with respect to the galaxies, but also that the\nabsorber-galaxy correlation function is not as strong as the galaxy-galaxy\ncorrelation function on large scales. Our data are consistent with the\nhypothesis that all galaxies more luminous than 1/10 L* have effective\ncross-sections (for association with absorbers with Log(NH)>13.0), of between\n0.5 and 1 Mpc. We also show a clear case of a Lya absorber which has no galaxy\nbrighter than MB=-18 within a projected distance of 4.8 Mpc, and discuss the\npossibility that Lya absorbers are destroyed in a rich galaxy environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 1993 11:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We have also explored the dependence of the arm\nclass of a galaxy on other factors, such as its blue absolute magnitude and its\ndisk-to-total mass ratio, inferred in the literature either from the gradient\nof a good galaxy rotation curve or from a photometric mass decomposition\nmethod. We have found that the arm class is strongly related to the absolute\nmagnitude in the mid-type spirals (in the sense that grand design galaxies are,\non average, more luminous than flocculent objects), whilst this relation is\nconsiderably weaker in the early and late types. In general the influence of\nthe local density on the arm structure appears to be much weaker than that of\nthe absolute magnitude. The local density acts essentially in strengthening the\narm class--absolute magnitude relation for the mid types, whereas no\nenvironmental density effects are observed in the early and late types. Using\nthe most recent estimates of the disk-to-total mass ratio, we do not confirm\nthis ratio to be a significant factor which affects the arm class;\nnevertheless, owing to poor statistics and large uncertanties, the issue\nremains open. Neither a local density effect nor an unambiguous bar effect on\nthe disk-to-total mass ratio is detectable; the latter finding may challenge\nsome theoretical viewpoints on the formation of bar structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jul 1993 15:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

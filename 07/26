We consider a box full of entropy lowered\ntowards and then dropped into a Reissner--Nordstr\\\"om black hole in equilibrium\nwith thermal radiation. We avoid the approximation that the buoyant pressure\nvaries slowly across the box, and compute the buoyant force exactly. We find,\nin agreement with independent investigations, that the neutral point\ngenerically lies very near the horizon. A consequence is that in the generic\ncase, the Unruh--Wald entropy restriction is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor enforcement of the generalized second law. Another consequence is that\ngenerically the buoyancy makes only a negligible contribution to the energy\nbookeeping, so that the original entropy bound is recovered if the generalized\nsecond law is assumed to hold. The number of particle species does not figure\nin the entropy bound, a point that has caused some perplexity. We demonstrate\nby explicit calculation that, for arbitrarily large number of particle species,\nthe bound is indeed satisfied by cavity thermal radiation in the thermodynamic\nregime, provided vacuum energies are included. We also show directly that\nthermal radiation in a cavity in $D$ dimensional space also respects the bound\nregardless of the value of $D$. As an application of the bound we show that it\nstrongly restricts the information capacity of the posited black hole remnants,\nso that they cannot serve to resolve the information paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jul 1993 16:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
